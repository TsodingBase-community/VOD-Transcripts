0,5620," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Amista Zozin."
5620,13020," So, you remember Doom? Doom was like a 3D game, but it was kind of like a, you know, fake 3D game."
13020,20780," So, the characters, the characters were obviously not 3D, they were actually 2D sprites, but they"
20780,26840," were rendered to kind of mimic the, like, third dimension. So, essentially, as you can see in here,"
26840,31620," so we have characters that look straight at the player and some of them are looking to the side."
31620,38940," So, obviously, what the developers had to do, they had to actually render the character at different"
38940,45060," angles, right, and then depending on the angle of the player and the angle of the entity or the"
45060,53140," character, they would actually pick a different sprite. So, we're developing a kind of similar game"
53140,57480," with a similar engine, right, so you can find the source code in the description and for people in"
57480,62740," the chat because we're streaming right now on Twitch, right, I'm going to put it in the chat."
62740,67940," So, let's actually open it up. So, we've been developing this thing for, I think, a month,"
67940,72200," maybe less than a month. So, we're slowly developing this entire stuff and as you can see,"
72200,77240," we already have sprites, right, so these sort of, like, billboards that always face at the player"
77240,83100," and the reason why they always face at the player is because no projection is applied to them,"
83100,91200," we just slap them on the screen. We figure out where the point in 3D is going to be projected on"
91200,97200," the screen and just in that specific point, we just slap the 2D image onto the screen and that's why"
97200,103640," it creates this sort of effect that the, you know, the image is always rotated towards the player,"
103640,108140," right, it's an illusion actually, right, it's because we always slap it onto the screen"
108140,114780," without any projection. So, we are kind of slowly moving towards adding multiplayer to this game"
114780,122200," and that means that we need some sort of a way to represent the players in the game, right,"
122200,129820," so that means we are going to have these characters that can see each other and they also can be at"
129820,135060," different orientations, right, so they can look at different, in different directions and we need to"
135060,140940," somehow reflect that, right, so because we're going to be shooting, like, bombs, throwing bombs and maybe"
140940,146220," maybe some other projectiles and you need to be aware of the direction you're aiming looking at."
146220,154100," It's kind of important, the game has to indicate that somehow. So, I actually did a quick sketch of the"
154100,159980," of the potential player sprite, right, so it's not finished, it's sort of like a, again, sketch, like"
159980,168080," I outlined how it's going to look like. So, this is how it looks like, right, so this is basically what's"
168080,172680," the player going to look like. I think for different players, we're going to customize the"
172680,177440," the color of the body, the color of the eye and stuff like that"
177440,181600," and I actually drew this player at different directions, right, so"
181600,185720," eight directions. So, if you play them as an animation, it feels like the"
185720,189860," the player is rotating, right, so I actually drew all of that manually"
189860,193600," so we can even do it like that. So, what I want you to do today"
193600,203360," is to actually just implement a renderer that can actually pick a correct sprite of the direction"
203360,209520," based on the angle of the camera and the angle of the entity. So, this is what I want to spend"
209520,214480," the time on on today's stream, right. I think it's going to be interesting because I don't really know"
214480,220960," how exactly they do that. It's probably related to the angle between two vectors, between the vector of the"
220960,227920," camera and the vector of the entity, but also I think the projection of the camera also plays a role, right."
227920,235600," So, we'll see, we'll see actually. I already converted this entire sprite sheet into like an"
235600,240320," actual sprite sheet. So, it looks like this, but you can't really see that. So, let me actually do"
240320,247280," something like white. Right, so this is a sprite sheet. Let me disable the enter everything."
247280,257040," So, yeah, what is the first thing I want to do? I want to maybe create a sprite in the world"
257760,263680," that renders one of these things. So, this entire thing is basically concatenated into a single image."
263680,269520," It's called Atlas. I need an ability to actually say, okay, render the sprite, but actually"
269520,277040," this sub-image of the sprite. As far as I know right now, our engine doesn't have that ability."
277040,282560," The only thing it can do is that you give it an image and it just renders an entire image"
282560,288080," as the sprite. So, we need to be able to actually render sub-images so we can have this sort of like,"
288080,292800," um, you know, entities at different angles. Right, so let's actually see how we can do that."
292800,299200," Uh, sounds good. Sounds Gucci. Tamaguchi, as usual. Okay, let's go. Um, so we have"
299200,307280," uh, watch mode, which is nice. So, let's go into the game TS. So, all of that is written in TypeScript."
307280,316880," So, where do we render the whole thing? So, we render it somewhere here. Um, I think we need to first load"
316880,322480," the image into the asset. So, we have a function create game, right? So, and in here we're gonna"
322480,329680," literally load image data and the player, if I'm not mistaken, if I'm not mistaken, is located somewhere"
329680,339440," here. It's assets image images custom player dot png. So, let's go ahead and simply load this entire thing"
339440,346000," like so. It's a web development, right? So, it's simple. Like, anybody can be a web developer. It's not"
346000,350080," like we're developing an operating system or anything. It's just like, you know, websites,"
350080,356560," right? Silly little websites. Silly little websites. So, okay. So, everything seems to be compiling and"
356560,362880," let's actually maybe all open dev tools. Uh, open dev tools and let's take a look at"
362880,371280," uh, the network. Did it actually load the player? Uh, here's the player png. I can see it. So,"
372160,378640," can I preview? Oh, there we go. It actually even shows it. Yo, look at that like a glow and stuff like"
378640,385440," that. Fancy. Oh my god. So, dev tools is trying to display everything in a fancy way. Holy shit. Anyway,"
385440,395120," right. Uh, so, and I suppose we need to add the um, the player image. So, this one has to be like this. So,"
395120,403600," we're sort of decomposing player image data and we have an interface for like assets, all of the assets"
403600,408880," that we have in the game, right? So, image for the key or image for the bomb and different sounds and"
408880,414160," stuff like that. So, I suppose we need to have a player image data in here, right? So, here is the"
414160,421120," player image data. Okay. So, after that, after we loaded the player image data, we're simply adding it"
421120,427440," into the assets. So, now we do in fact have that in the assets. Do we have any compilation errors? We"
427440,433520," don't have any compilation errors. Perfect. All right. So, what's the next thing we want to do? After we"
433520,440800," updated players, items, bombs and stuff like that, I suppose we need to print like render a sprite. The"
440800,447360," way you render a sprite in this engine, right, in this sort of engine is by calling the function push"
447360,454320," sprite. So, let's actually find the definition. Push, uh, push sprite. So, the reason it's called push"
454320,459760," sprite is because you're pushing a sprite into the sprite pool because they are not rendered right away."
459760,465600," First, you're accumulating all of the sprites that you want to render and then there's a whole pipeline"
465600,471120," going on that actually removes some of this, some of the sprites that are not visible on the screen."
471120,476960," They're the ones that are too far away and stuff like that. Then it sorts them and uh, so on and so"
476960,481120," forth, right? So, if you want to render something, it's not really rendered right away. It's just pushed"
481120,487840," into the pool and then that pool goes through the entire sort of like a pipeline. Uh, right. So, the"
487840,493680," actual rendering of the sprite happens much later, right? It happens somewhere here actually. So, it's like a"
493680,500000," cool and sort sprites, right? So, I don't remember how you pronounce cool. Is it call or cool? I don't"
500000,505120," speak English. I really apologize for that. So, so first you sort of like remove the ones that are not"
505120,510640," visible, then you sort them by the distance and stuff like that and only then you kind of render them."
510640,516640," Okay, so first you have to specify the sprite pool, right? So, what we're doing here, we get the sprite pool"
516640,523840," from here. Then we have to specify the image. We do in fact have image. We do in fact have image. It's"
523840,530080," located in the assets. So, the first one like skull. Oh, okay. Thank you. So, this is actually very good"
530080,542000," mnemonic like a skull. So, it's a call. Um, okay. So, it's assets, uh, player, uh, it's not, oh, it's a"
542000,548720," assets are located within the game. Game, assets, player image data. Then we have to specify the"
548720,553440," position where it's going to be located. So, let's actually put it somewhere at zero zero, right? So,"
553440,558480," as far as I know, the default arguments for x and y are zero zero. So, if I don't provide any arguments,"
558480,565920," it's, it's basically that. Okay. So, z is basically the height. Uh, so, essentially, I think I can put"
565920,572960," one. So, that means it's going to be at the ceiling, right? Because the distance from the floor and the"
572960,579120," ceiling is actually one. Zero, that means the thing is going to be at the floor. One, it means it's going"
579120,584160," to be at the ceiling. So, we're going to put it at the ceiling and the size is also going to be one,"
584160,588320," right? So, it's basically going to take the whole space from the floor to the"
588320,593120," ceiling. Hopefully, we'll see how it goes. Okay. So, does it compile? It seems to be"
593120,600640," compiling. Okay. So, and let's see if we can see anything in there. So, maybe I had to refresh."
600640,609520," Let's actually refresh the whole thing. Oh. So, right now, you can only have square sprites,"
610560,617440," right? And, as you can see, it's actually, so, it tried to fit the entirety of the thing into the,"
617440,623360," like, this square. Uh, so, and this is basically the sprite sheet. You can see the player at different"
623360,629600," angles, essentially, right? So, it's an iron fence. Yeah, exactly. It's an iron fence. Uh, so, but it's"
629600,633680," actually the sprite sheet of all of the, all of these things. It's just, like, compressed into,"
634240,640400," into, into a square. So, I'd like to maybe put it a little bit closer to the, sort of, like, a gateway,"
640400,646000," uh, that we have in here. Right? So, here we have this, sort of, gateway. Uh, so, let me see if hot"
646000,651920," reloading still works. Does it work? Oh, yeah. It still works. Okay. Look at that. So, maybe I can now put"
651920,658000," something, like, happen here. Uh, right. So, is it working? Is it working? Yeah. So, it's, it's working. It's"
658000,664960," working. So, as you can see, we have hot reloading without any byte. Can your byte do that? I can't"
664960,673440," think so. Right. I should stop. I should probably stop. Actually, the last time I attracted too much"
673440,679200," attention from the creator of the bit. So, for my, for my stupid memes, I really apologize for that. So,"
679200,684880," I just want to say that I'm just memeing around, right? I'm just memeing around. I don't even know"
684880,692000," what this beat, honestly. I'm not the web developer, okay? I'm not the web developer."
692000,701040," Uh, so, anyway, uh, what do I want you to do? Uh, I probably need to maybe extend push sprites,"
701040,709120," where I could specify, um, you know, how I want to cut out the image, right? So, I specify the image,"
709120,714800," and then I probably could specify the rectangle, um, right? But the thing is, the thing is,"
715520,719120," if I'm going to be specifying the rectangle, it has to be reflected within the"
719120,724400," sprite itself, right? Because we have a interface for the sprite. So, interface"
724400,730720," sprite. So, here is a sprite, and here we specify the pushed sprite. It has an image, which is either"
730720,736880," image data or color. Uh, it has position, z-scale, and there is some intermediate data that is computed"
736880,742640," throughout the pipeline. You never really specified, like, any of this stuff. This is the data, again,"
742640,747280," that is computed throughout the pipeline. For example, the distance from the, uh, from the object to the"
747280,752480," player, like a normalized horizontal distance, and so on and so forth, right? So, what we could do in"
752480,759120," here, what we could do in here, we could basically say crop position, right? So, basically, if we're"
759120,765520," cropping an image, uh, where is the left upper corner of the cropping rectangle, right? So, this is going"
765520,771040," to be crop position, and also, we want to introduce something like crop size, right? So, what's the"
771040,775600," size of the rectangle? So, as you can see, we have two vectors, and they represent the rectangle that we"
775600,782400," want to, uh, we want to crop. Uh, what's interesting is that, so, what if you don't want to crop, right? So,"
782400,789040," how are we going to be doing that? Um, what we can do in here is that if you call push, right, and you"
789040,794240," don't want to crop, you just specify the crop position to be zero, zero, and crop size the size"
794240,799440," of the entire image, and there you go, you just render the entire image, right? So, we can always"
799440,803920," crop it, it's just like, if you don't want to crop it, just like, specify the entirety of the image,"
803920,809840," right? So, I guess that makes sense, right? So, I guess that makes sense. So, um, so, if I do push"
809840,816720," sprite, so, in here, we, you have to specify crop position, which is going to be a vector, and a crop size,"
816720,825600," which is going to be vector, we do have push size calls throughout the code, and when, and what we"
825600,830960," meant throughout the code is that we don't want to crop. So, what I'm thinking is that maybe we could"
830960,837680," make crop position and crop size optional parameters. So, and if you don't specify any of these parameters,"
837680,842480," you just mean the entirety of the image. So, when somebody calls this thing and doesn't provide crop,"
842480,848000," uh, position and crop image, we just set them to zero zero and the entirety of the thing."
848000,855040," So, that makes sense. So, you only crop the image when you actually specify these parameters. I think"
855040,860640," it makes sense. I think it's fair. Uh, right. So, that way we don't break any of the existing code."
860640,867440," So, I think that's pretty cool. All right. So, here is a very interesting thing. So, the sprite pool is"
867440,873920," actually a pool. So, that means it reuses the objects that, uh, you push in there, right? So,"
873920,882480," essentially, um, if the capacity, um, if the size of the pool is about to become bigger than its capacity,"
882480,887440," right? So, because we have items, uh, right? So, and we don't really deallocate these items,"
887440,891840," right? So, because we're programming in JavaScript, right? In a garbage collected language, we're trying to"
891840,898000," preserve the object so the garbage collector doesn't try to, uh, you know, collect them. So, um, because"
898000,903920," it's a usual pattern in these kind of languages, right? So, where you just have a pool of objects"
903920,909200," that live forever and you just reuse these objects, right? So, that's what we're doing in here. So,"
909200,915200," and here we're pushing an object and, uh, if we don't have one and otherwise we're just reusing"
915200,920800," one of the latest one. I don't know why I separated this entire thing, honestly. I don't know why I"
920800,928400," separated it. I feel like it would be better to maybe not make it an else, but actually just let"
928400,934960," it fall through in a sense. Right. I think, I think that makes more sense. I don't really know why I did"
934960,941600," it like that. So, essentially, if you're about to overflow the capacity, we just pre-allocate"
941600,947360," an additional object and after that we fall through in here and we just use that new object that we"
947360,952880," pre-allocated. That only makes sense, I think. That only makes sense. So, then the only thing we're doing"
952880,957280," here is just like we're cloning the position. Uh, we don't really have to clone it, right? So, if we"
957280,963200," just create it, then down there, when it falls through, it's going to be set to a new position"
963200,967200," anyway. So, we don't really have to do that. So, the only thing we need to add in here is probably crop"
967200,974400," position, right? So, let's create a new vector 2 and here we're going to have the crop size,"
974400,979520," right? So, we just pre-allocated all these things. Okay. This one is really interesting. This one is"
979520,986320," really interesting. I don't really like how huge of an expression this is. It just points at the last"
986320,993680," thing. Can we, can we just factor it out into something like index or maybe, maybe last. All right. So,"
993680,998480," this is going to be last. So, this is the last thing in here. Yeah, there we go. So, that's a little bit,"
998480,1004080," it's a little bit better, I think. That's a little bit better. All right. So, essentially,"
1004080,1013200," the easiest thing would be, in our case, honestly, just take the crop position and just simply set"
1013200,1019280," the crop position that we were provided in here, right? So, we provided a crop position and then crop size,"
1019840,1027040," right? So, that would be the easiest thing. But it's not that easy because this thing can be missing,"
1027040,1031200," right? Because before we didn't even have this parameter. So, we kind of need to maintain backward"
1031200,1039840," compatibility with existing code. So, crop position might be missing. It might be missing. So, okay. So,"
1039840,1046640," let's do a very simple thing. If crop position, so what does it say? What it can be equal to? Is it,"
1046640,1056960," is it going to be equal to, right? So, oh, it's actually copying, right? Okay. So, what it can be,"
1056960,1063120," can be equal to undefined or null? Oh, it, okay. So, if it's optional, it could be equal to undefined. So,"
1063120,1069600," we have to check for the undefined. So, if this thing, if this thing is equal to undefined,"
1069600,1075760," what we have to do instead of copying it is to set to 00, right? So, that's what we have to do in here."
1075760,1082240," So, we'll just do set 00. There we go. So, if you provided crop position,"
1082240,1087440," we're going to use that crop position. If you didn't provide it, we're going to just set it to 00,"
1087440,1091200," basically the left upper corner, right? So, makes sense. Very easy."
1091200,1099840," Very, very easy. So, in case of the crop size, in case of the crop size, this one is rather interesting."
1099840,1108160," So, if you did in fact provide it, you just copied, but what if you didn't provide it? If crop size"
1108160,1116080," is equal to undefined, we don't really know what we want to do in here. So, if we didn't provide the"
1116080,1121200," crop size, the obvious thing that you want to set in here, right? The obvious thing that you want to"
1121200,1127920," set in here is actually the entirety of the image probably, right? So, we have an image and this is"
1127920,1133760," where we're starting to have a little bit of a problem. Image is not necessarily an image. It could"
1133760,1140400," be a solid color, right? So, sometimes you want to create a sprite that is just solid color and it does"
1140400,1147440," make sense because, for example, the particles when the when the bomb blows up, they're solid colors,"
1147440,1153040," believe it or not. As you can see, they're in fact solid colors, right? So, this is one of the options"
1153040,1159440," that you can have in here. And how can you set the size of the solid color? It doesn't have a size."
1160160,1166560," That's the thing. It doesn't have a size. Right. So, if image was image, we could have just done something"
1166560,1174240," like image, maybe width and image height. So, maybe one of the things we have to do before"
1174240,1181120," doing any of that stuff is to check that the image that was provided by the user is actually image data"
1181120,1188640," and not the caller. Right. So, let's do it like this. If image instance of... What kind of Java is that?"
1188640,1196640," Like, why JavaScript has instance of operate? I mean, it also has the word Java in the name,"
1196640,1200480," which is kind of... But at the same time, it doesn't really look like Java. Like,"
1200480,1207520," what the is going on with the branding of this language, honestly? Is it Java related or not Java"
1207520,1212800," related? Okay, it's not Java related. Why the fuck does it have instance of them? It's like the most"
1212800,1220560," Java thing I've ever seen in my entire life. So, yeah. Where is your god now? If JavaScript is not"
1220560,1227440," related to Java, what the fuck is instance of? What the fuck is instance of? Oh, the real name is Emacs script."
1227440,1235280," Yeah. Okay. So, that explains it. Emacs script. I think this is a new way to piss off web developers. Like,"
1236000,1241680," Yo! I'm gonna... From now on, I'm gonna call ECMAScript Emacs script. Yes."
1241680,1254080," Anyway. So, instance of image data. All right. So, what do we have in here? So, this is the image data."
1254080,1263120," But if it's color, cropping this thing kind of becomes meaningless almost. Right. It kind of becomes"
1263120,1268880," meaningless. If it's just a color, we can just set crop position and crop size to zero, essentially."
1268880,1277840," Right. It was inspired by Java trying to pull Java applet devs. Yeah, I guess so. From what I heard,"
1277840,1286320," from what I heard, it was basically Java was like a buzzword at the time. So, they were just trying to capitalize on that."
1287280,1294640," So, it's like these days creating a new language and calling it Rust script. Right. So, it was just like,"
1294640,1300960," you know, the hype thing of the day. So, it's basically the same thing. Anyway."
1301760,1306800," So, even though that language would be not related to Rust. Right. You still call it Rust script to capitalize"
1306800,1315280," on all of the hyped up devs. So, I suppose if image is just a color, we probably want to set crop"
1315280,1323840," position and crop size to zero. So, it's actually zero them out. Rust script. Yeah, exactly."
1323840,1334320," So, zero, zero. And this one is going to be crop size, crop size, crop size. Okay. So, that makes sense,"
1334320,1340720," I suppose. If it's image, we just do some shenanigans. If it's not image, we just set both of them to zero and"
1340720,1348080," that works out. Here's an interesting thing. I don't think it is correct to set the crop size to the"
1348080,1356080," entirety of the image. Right. It makes sense if the crop position is set to zero, zero. But what if somebody,"
1356080,1362320," what if the user of this function set the crop position but didn't set the crop size?"
1364000,1370320," Think about that. Think about that for a second. Actually, I think I'm going to start. I don't even"
1370320,1379920," have to start my paint. I can just use this thing. Wait a second. 256, 256. Right. Imagine that you have"
1379920,1388400," this kind of image. Can I have a rectangle of some sort? Can I just create? Yo, I can have a rectangle."
1388400,1393280," Okay. Okay. That's pretty cool. So, now, imagine, imagine, imagine, imagine. You set the position"
1393280,1399440," somewhere here. Right. So, here is the position. But you didn't set the crop size. What it will do,"
1399440,1405520," it will essentially set the size to the entirety of this image. So, you will have a doubled image"
1405520,1417360," that goes outside. So, what you have to set is actually you have to cut out the parts that overflow that image."
1418400,1424000," Right. I think that's what you have to do. So, essentially, we set the entirety of the"
1424000,1432320," of the image. But then we want to kind of subtract the, yeah, the position in here. So, we can just"
1432320,1437920," like take the crop position and we're just subtracting this entire thing. I think that makes sense."
1437920,1443280," Yeah. So, image size minus crop position. Exactly. Exactly. So, that's what we're doing in here."
1444400,1449680," Right. And with our current vector 2 implementation, we can quite easily do that. Right. So, because sub"
1449680,1456240," actually modifies this thing in place. So, this is image size, crop size, blah, blah, blah. All right."
1456240,1458880," So, this is defined, undefined."
1464240,1471360," All right. That's pretty cool. Ah, I didn't want to do that. So, we still compiling, which is nice."
1471360,1481360," Right. So, it is super, super nice. Let me see. We now want to... It's actually moves really fast,"
1481360,1491040," surprisingly. I don't know why. What changed? I don't know. So, what is the size of a single frame"
1491040,1497200," in the player? I don't really know what's the size of this entire thing. Oh, okay. I see. I think it's"
1497200,1505200," 55 by 55. Okay. So, I don't really know why I choose 55 by 55. But that's what it is. Okay. So,"
1505200,1511840," crop position. Crop position is going to be, let's say, 0, 0. Right. And crop size is going to be"
1513040,1520000," actually 55 by 55. Right. So, let's actually set it to 55 by 55. Is it going to work? Is it going to"
1520000,1527840," work? Or I think it got kind of stuck. Ah, I see. Yeah. So, we introduced all these new parameters,"
1527840,1534960," like crop position and crop size. But we didn't actually use them in render sprites. Right. So,"
1534960,1541120," after we sorted out all of the sprites, right, we need to actually use all of that stuff. Okay."
1541120,1546160," So, here's... If the sprite is image data, we do one thing. If it's color, we do another thing. So,"
1546160,1550400," if it's color, we don't have to crop anything. We're just basically ignoring here. Okay. This one is"
1550400,1560720," interesting. So, here is the position of this entire thing. Yeah. Okay. So, we are trying to figure out"
1560720,1569760," tx and ty, which are the coordinates on the sprite sheet. On the sprite sheet. So, by doing this thing,"
1569760,1578720," by taking this value and dividing it by sprite size, we're finding the normalized x from 0 to 1,"
1578720,1585120," and then we're denormalizing it by multiplying by, I suppose, the entirety of the size. So,"
1585120,1596080," what I think we need to do in here is actually use crop size x and crop size. So, we have to use"
1596080,1603920," crop size in here. Crop size, crop y. All right. So, that we're using the size of the actual sub-image"
1603920,1610000," in here. And in here, then, we are trying to find the point on the sprite sheet. So,"
1610000,1614000," in the point on the sprite sheet, we actually have to be offset by the crop position. So,"
1614000,1623200," what we have to do in here is add sprite, crop position, crop position x, not x, y. Right. So,"
1623200,1631920," we're offsetting this entire thing. And then, plus sprite, crop position y. Do we have to do anything else in here? Okay."
1631920,1639440," Okay. So, then, we have x and y. What is x and y? X and y are going from the boundaries,"
1639440,1645760," and the boundaries. These are the screen boundaries, right? So, they have nothing to do with actually"
1645760,1650320," the sprite stuff. So, I guess that's it. I don't really see anything else in here."
1650320,1656960," So, I don't actually see anything else in here. So, I think it's fine. So, there's a compile seems to"
1656960,1666640," become a... Yo! What the fuck? Yo! It's looking at that. Holy shit. It's so ominous,"
1666640,1674480," by the way. If you refresh it. Like, imagine, like, going... What the fuck is... It's so fucking ominous looking at that."
1676480,1684000," Man, the fuck is so fucking ominous. I was just like, what the fuck? It's a horror game. What the fuck?"
1684000,1689280," You can't see. You can't see. Okay. All right."
1689280,1703120," What the fuck? Scary. Anyway. So, what you can do, actually, we can now maybe pick a different frame. Since we're rendering sub images now."
1704080,1711680," Right. So, we're rendering sub images. We can maybe even offset some of the things. Right. So, here is the"
1711680,1716480," crop size and here is the position. So, that means if I do something like 55, zero, it's going to be the"
1716480,1720880," next frame. Is it going to be the next frame? Is it going to be the next frame? I don't know."
1720880,1728240," Did it save it? I think I'm pretty sure it saved it. I guess it didn't pick up. No, it didn't freaking"
1728240,1732880," pick up. What the fuck? So, that's bizarre."
1732880,1745120," Let me refresh the compilation. Maybe it didn't compile. Maybe it didn't compile properly. All right."
1745120,1753200," It's compiling. It is compiling. Okay. So, now, if I refresh... No, it's still this one. It's kind of"
1753200,1761680," bizarre. What's up with that? What's up with that? Did I do a fucky walkie? I don't remember"
1761680,1768880," doing any fucky walking here. So, this is that and this is... Ah, I see. I already found an error. I"
1768880,1775920," already found an error. It's supposed to be X. Okay. All right. Yeah. Look at that. Look at that."
1776560,1783120," Look at that. It's now looking to the side. It's now looking to the side. It's pretty cool. Now, I can"
1783120,1790400," probably multiply by two. So, that will be the next frame now. And now it's rotated. So, we can multiply"
1790400,1795360," by three. So, essentially, this is the index of the frame, right? We can even factor it out to like index,"
1795360,1803920," right? And our job, essentially, is going to be to map two vectors. The vector of the player and the"
1803920,1809520," vector of the entity where the entity is looking into this index so we can display it on the screen,"
1809520,1817120," right? So, that's basically the job, the task at hand. What's interesting is that maybe we can actually"
1817120,1822880," animate this entire thing over time, right? Because we do have time. We pass the time."
1822880,1831440," We even have just a global time. So, what if I take the time and maybe I essentially take a mod"
1832640,1838240," over eight, right? So, because we have eight different frames, right? So, if we mod it like"
1838240,1845520," eight and then floor it, we basically get a different index over time. So, that means it's going to be"
1845520,1853520," rotating. All right. So, it's rotating, right? So, we're just like animating the index and it just"
1853520,1861200," switches the frames and stuff. So, that's actually pretty cool. That's actually pretty cool. So,"
1861200,1865840," can we make it faster? Can I multiply it by two? Will it make it faster if I multiply by two?"
1865840,1871840," It's kind of bizarre. Okay. So, it is actually faster. Yeah. So, what about..."
1871840,1877280," Eh, I didn't want to do that. What about 16 now? Right. So,"
1877280,1883280," Look at him go. Look at him fucking go."
1883280,1890400," So, it's actually pretty cool. That's actually pretty cool. I really like that."
1891440,1899200," It's really funny. So, okay. So, let's actually bring back the maybe something like zero. Let's"
1899200,1905200," actually bring back something like zero. So, okay. There we go. So, now we need to figure out how the"
1905200,1909680," fuck can we even do that. How the fuck can we even do that?"
1909680,1917680," But maybe, maybe I want to make a small break. Right. So, I think the time has come for me to"
1917680,1924320," make a cup of tea. So, it's not really super hot anymore. Right. And that means I can actually drink"
1924320,1930880," hot tea now and get some coffee into my system. So, I think I would like to take that opportunity."
1930880,1936480," Right. And make a small break. So, what do you think? Sprite flavor tea? No, it's going to be just like"
1936480,1944240," green tea. Right. So, tea is back. Tea is back. Okay. All right. We're back. So, let's try to figure out"
1944240,1950240," what exactly we need to do. Maybe we'll need to draw a little bit before, you know, we can start coding."
1951120,1958480," Before we can start coding. Okay. So, let's imagine that you have a player."
1958480,1966080," So, I need to pick an appropriate brush before I can do all of that stuff. So, here you are. Maybe I"
1966080,1971200," want to actually do something like this. And come on. You can do that. Show me the... Okay. There we go."
1971200,1978400," So, this is the player. Player. So, this is the player. And the player... Let's just assume that the"
1978400,1986240," player looking up. Right. So, the player looking up. And then we have an enemy or some other entity."
1986240,1995040," Right. Let's call it an enemy. Like so. And the enemy is looking down. Right. The enemy is looking down."
1995040,2005200," If you put these two vectors side by side. All right. So, this is the player's vector. Right. This is the player's"
2005200,2012080," vector. It's looking up. And this is the enemy's vector. It's looking down."
2012080,2024400," So, that means that at the angle of 180 degrees, at the angle of 180 degrees, you have to show the first"
2024400,2030480," frame of the frame of the frame of the frame of the frame of the frame. It's looking at us."
2030480,2038960," So, that way, that means that I'm looking upwards and they're looking in the opposite direction."
2038960,2045360," So, it means at 180 degrees, we have to show the first one. So, then,"
2046880,2054720," essentially, we are having another vector in here, which is probably looking like this. And that means"
2054720,2062480," we have a smaller degree in here. So, it's 180 minus 45. Right. So, because we have eight directions in"
2062480,2068240," here. Right. So, we have eight directions. Then it's going to be 90. So, that means it's going to be 90 in"
2068240,2078240," here and so on and so forth. So, the way to figure out what index we have to show is by computing the"
2078240,2085200," angle between the two vectors, between the vector of the player and the vector of the enemy. So,"
2085200,2093040," let me see. If we take a look at the player, where is the player? So, this is the game. Within the game,"
2093040,2099120," we have a player and within the player you have a... Okay. Direction is an angle. Right. So, direction"
2099120,2106240," is an angle. So, we already have an angle of the player. We need to introduce the angle of the entity."
2106240,2115280," Right. So, let's say entity angle. Right. And let's say that it's going to point maybe at zero currently."
2115280,2122240," Right. So, it is pointing at zero. And essentially, we need to somehow create a function. Right. A function"
2122240,2129600," that accepts game player direction and entity angle as well. I mean, for the consistency, for the sake of"
2129600,2136400," consistency, let's actually call it entity direction. Right. So, we need to create a function that,"
2136400,2144880," given these two angles, gives us the index within that spritesheet. And that is going to be basically"
2144880,2149760," the goal of the stream. Right. So, somehow we need to do that."
2149760,2157200," The most annoying part, the most annoying part is that what's the value of the angle?"
2157200,2165840," You can try to subtract one angle from another one. Right. But what if the player's vector is just like"
2166960,2177440," minus 720 degrees. Right. What if it's that? So, you kind of have to normalize the vector first. I think"
2177440,2183680," we had a similar problem when I was developing my game in Ada. Right. So, we even had a function to sort"
2183680,2189920," of compute the... You have two angles. Right. So, how you find the angle between them or something like that."
2191280,2201920," So, let me see what we can do in here. Right. So, maybe we could actually display all of that stuff"
2201920,2206320," in the minimap. Right. So, as you can see here, we're just rendering the FPS."
2206320,2214080," We're just rendering the FPS. Can I add some text in here? So, first of all, here is the minimap. Right."
2214080,2218240," So, we're in... Do we need a minimap? I'm not sure if we really care about the minimap."
2218960,2229840," So, what is going on in here? So, let me put zero like so. So, here is the zero. Is it going to work?"
2229840,2240240," Is it going to work? Okay. So, that seems to be working. Now, I want to render some text. We already have"
2240240,2250960," this text in here. So, maybe I can do fill text. So, this is going to be something like test. Can I put"
2250960,2257440," this stuff in here? Can you render this thing, please, for me? It's taking some time. It's lagging like"
2257440,2262080," fucking crazy, mate. So, this is because the context is a part of the display. Okay."
2265120,2273520," Okay. So, it still doesn't work because... So, come on. Let's open DevTools and see what's going on in here."
2273520,2280240," So, it's obviously crashed. But why did it crash? It's not defined. That's bizarre because..."
2280240,2288000," Here it is. It didn't not refresh. Okay. So, it just didn't refresh for fuck's sake. Okay. So, here's the test."
2288000,2295040," Okay. I want to put it maybe somewhere down there, like 200. Yep. There we go. So, now I have a test in"
2295040,2298800," here. So, perfect. So, I have some place where I can put some debug information if I want to."
2298800,2308960," So, the player angle is more like game player direction, right? So, this is the player angle."
2308960,2313280," So, here it is. Show me. Yeah. There we go. It's in reds."
2314080,2322000," Goddamn. It's in reds. Okay. So, how can I convert it to degrees? I have to divide it by the pie and"
2322000,2328720," multiply it by 180. So, that's going to be in degrees. I'm pretty sure. So, this is in degrees."
2328720,2334720," So, when I'm... Yeah. So, it could be negative. It could be pretty much negative. But it actually goes"
2334720,2341200," negative. Look at that. Right. So, the actual value stored there when I'm rotating around is negative."
2341200,2346080," You do need to normalize all of that stuff. You do need to normalize all of that stuff."
2346080,2353920," So, maybe I'm... Obviously, I probably want to have something like a player entity. Player"
2353920,2360640," direction. Right. So, this is going to be player direction. Game player direction or something like"
2360640,2369520," that. So, and let's put it in here. Player direction. So, the first thing we want to do..."
2369520,2378240," Emax. Okay. So, we want to do mod and... But we want to mod it at math pi multiplied by 2. Right. So,"
2378240,2385520," because the full circle is 2 pi. Right. So, this is a 2 pi. Right. And that should..."
2385520,2393840," Now, if it compiles... Please compile. Maybe. Why doesn't it compile? Okay. So, it compiled."
2393840,2400160," When it goes negative. It still goes negative. This is because we need to use proper mod."
2400160,2410640," Wait. So, I suppose... Yeah, yeah. When it goes negative, it wraps around... Yeah. You need to have a proper"
2410640,2418080," mode in here. You can't just use the stinky mode with, you know, with the percent and stuff like that. You"
2418080,2423120," need to have a proper mode. I think we had a proper mode in here somewhere. No! We even had a proper"
2423120,2430320," mode in multiplayer game. Right. So, we even had in a multiplayer game. So, I need to pour that thing from"
2430320,2438080," there. Where is the client? So, proper mode. It's not even in a client. I think it's part of the common stuff."
2438080,2444160," So, proper... Yeah. There we go. This is what we need in here. So, that's what we have to do in here. Look"
2444160,2450000," at that shit. Look at that. So, this is a proper mode. I'm not sure if I want to export it from the module,"
2450000,2461760," but that's the thing we have to do anyway. Yeah. Proper... Proper mode. Like so. This is the proper mode."
2461760,2471600," Okay. Yep. All right. So, that's a proper mode. If I... Yeah. Then now everything's fine. Now everything's"
2471600,2478320," fine. I don't have to worry about that. So, I know that the value of that angle of the player's direction is"
2478320,2483360," going to be from 0 to 2 pi or 360 degrees doesn't really matter. Right. So, we're only displaying"
2483360,2493280," degrees, but the actual computations are happening in rats anyway. So, okay. So, now we have the entity"
2493280,2502800," direction. So, regardless of the entity direction, we probably have to do something else in here. So,"
2502800,2508000," I'm still thinking how I want to approach this entire thing, because where do I get this value?"
2508320,2512800," Right. Where do I get this value? I get it from somewhere, but it doesn't really matter."
2512800,2518560," So, it looks like a stupid expression. Right. It looks very stupid, but this is because I,"
2518560,2523360," like in the future, I'm going to be plugging in something from here. Right. So, I'm going to be"
2523360,2529360," plugging in something from here. Okay. So, I have two values. One is from 0 to 2 pi. Another one"
2529360,2536720," also from 0 to 2 pi. So, now I can maybe subtract one from another. Right. But the question is which one"
2536720,2547360," from which one I want to subtract. Right. So, if I'm looking up, I'm at 90. Right. I'm at 90 and I'm"
2547360,2556960," subtracting the bigger one. Right. I'm subtracting the bigger one. So, if I'm looking down, this is"
2556960,2570400," supposed to be 90 multiplied by 3. Right. So, looking down is 180 plus 90. So, it's 270 degrees. Right. So,"
2570400,2583040," we can actually kind of try to emulate that. So, math pi. Right. So, math pi. And I need to divide it"
2583040,2590400," by 2, but then I need to multiply it by 3. So, something like that. Yeah. So, we can even do it"
2590400,2599120," like this. Does it make sense? Does it make sense? I think it makes sense. So, that's the thing we have."
2600160,2607920," And when I'm subtracting, you know, player direction from entity direction, I get a negative"
2607920,2615120," value. That's the thing. Right. So, let's actually maybe put a in here. Right. So, put a in here."
2615120,2625120," And I simply want to put a just to see what's the difference between them. Right. So, this entire thing,"
2626400,2632480," where is zero? Right. If I'm at zero degrees, where exactly I'm looking at?"
2632480,2642880," Like, I'm not even sure. How can I figure that out? Maybe what I can do, I can set the player to look"
2642880,2650720," at zero. I can try to do that. So, if I'm not mistaken, in the index to s, all right, in the index to s,"
2650720,2658400," where... It's not even here, but it's somewhere create the game. Create game player. Okay. So, I'm..."
2658400,2664560," Oh, I can just specify the angle for the player. Right. That's actually pretty cool. Yeah. So, I can"
2664560,2671760," specify the direction. I can simply put zero in here and just see where the player is looking. All right."
2673600,2680240," Please refresh. Okay. So, I'm looking in kind of a weird... Aha. Aha. I see."
2680240,2691520," So, that means zero is looking towards... This is looking towards this wall. So, if I set..."
2691520,2699200," Yeah. Okay. So, this thing is already looking at zero. So, if the entity looking at the wall, that means the"
2699200,2707920," angle is zero. So, that's cool. That is very, very cool. So, that means that"
2707920,2722400," this is zero. And the positive one... Is it really positive? Aha. And the positive one... So, let me find the player direction."
2724400,2742640," Uh-huh. Yeah. No. This is negative one. All right. So, yeah. Let's actually keep it... Keep it at zero. All right. Let's keep it at zero."
2744640,2757440," Um... So, this is zero. Aha. So, we do direction and then we have a... Aha. Okay. So, let's actually do it like that."
2757440,2767840," So, right now we're looking at the difference between all of these things. Right. So, if I'm looking"
2769280,2778560," right at zero like that. It's actually still 180. It's actually 180. Okay. That's cool. All right."
2778560,2783520," So, now..."
2783520,2788800," what if I put..."
2793680,2800240," two... Math pi divided by two... Math pi divided by two. Almost said 100. Yeah, exactly."
2800240,2810240," So, this one is... The difference between them is 90. Okay. Um... I need to know..."
2814320,2823680," I need to know how this entire thing reacts. I need to know how this entire thing reacts."
2823680,2832320," So, what I'm thinking is... Maybe I can create a separate program like a test.js."
2832320,2840560," Test.js. So, you have a player direction and you have a player entity."
2841760,2845280," So, in all fairness, I would like them..."
2845280,2853360," So, the player is going to stay at some sort of thing. I think it's going to be math pi. Right. So,"
2853360,2859360," this is the player direction. And then we're going to be varying... Then we're going to be varying"
2859360,2865200," the entity's direction. So, how are we going to be varying? Let's actually iterate through the entire"
2865200,2871520," circle. So, let's actually rotate this entire thing. But let's rotate it at a very specific"
2871760,2881760," intervals. So, let's rotate it at a very specific intervals. So, let's do maybe let from 0 to 10."
2881760,2890080," Maybe we can even make it equal to 10. Something like that. Right. And the entity direction essentially is"
2890080,2902560," going to be going to be, you know, 2 math pi divided by 10. Maybe it makes sense to actually put, you know,"
2902560,2914080," 10 into this thing. Right. Into this thing. So, and then we multiply by i. Right. So, if I now print the entity"
2914080,2922000," direction. So, does it rotate around sort of speak? So, can I do node test.js? Okay. So, it's going from"
2922000,2928720," 0 to 6 something, something, something. If I divide it by math pi, multiply by 190. It's going to be"
2928720,2936560," from 0 to 360. Okay. So, that's totally fine. That is exactly what I want to do. So, and in the original"
2936560,2944160," game code, in the original game code, I take the player direction. Right. So, I take the player direction."
2944160,2951920," I subtract the entity direction. Right. So, subtract the entity direction. And what do I get in here?"
2951920,2962080," All right. So, this is going to be a. All right. All right. So, we do console log a. There we go. So,"
2962080,2970080," this is the value from one to another. Right. So, from one to another. And for example, if I subtract"
2970080,2976880," 2 math pi, the entire circle, this entire thing shifts around. All right. So, because one of the"
2976880,2986320," things we have to do, we have to do proper mode for 2 math pi. 2 math pi. And this one also proper mode."
2987680,2996640," entity to math pi. Like so. All right. And now, we don't have a proper mode, obviously. But that's"
2996640,3004480," fine. We can actually bring it. Proper mode. Where is that? Didn't I? Yeah. Here it is. Uh-huh. Let's put"
3004480,3010240," it in here. All right. So, that's the proper mode. Still doesn't like it something about. Oh, this is"
3010240,3015920," because it's not a, you know, TypeScript. It's actually JavaScript. All right. So, what do we"
3015920,3025200," have in here? Okay. So, this is the value. All right. So, and now if I remove this entire thing,"
3025200,3031200," it still stays the same. It still stays the same. Okay. That's pretty cool. All right."
3032800,3043760," So, if I look for example. So, the player direction is 180. Right. What if I say that it's going to be"
3043760,3054480," 90 degrees? Right. So, it's going to be 90 degrees. So, it's math pi. So, we're looking up. No. It doesn't"
3054480,3067680," really have to be this way. So, it's 180. And yeah. This is another 180. So, at this point,"
3067680,3082480," at this point, the angle of the enemy is actually zero. We are at 180 and the enemy is at zero. So,"
3082480,3089440," that means at this specific point, at this specific point, the index of the sprite sheet that we have to"
3089440,3098400," display to the player has to be zero. But this one is not. So, this one is equal to a whole pi, which is"
3098400,3108160," 180. Which means that we have to subtract an entire pi out of here to actually get a value from... Yeah,"
3108160,3116400," there we go. That makes sense, I think. All right. That's actually kind of cool. All right, all right,"
3116400,3128800," all right. So, yeah. You subtracting them and you basically... Yes, you basically get this thing. But"
3128800,3136160," now, the angle is kind of always negative. Right. The angle is always negative. Which means that what you"
3136160,3141920," probably want to do is maybe take an absolute value. All right. So, you take an absolute value."
3141920,3149840," It's not math pi. It's abs. So, this is the absolute value of this entire thing. All right. And you want"
3149840,3156800," to probably normalize it. You probably want to divide it by, you know, two math pi. So, you get the value from"
3156800,3162880," zero to one. Right. So, you normalize it. And then, you multiply it by the amount of things you have, the amount"
3162880,3170320," of indices. And then, you math floor it. You math floor the entire thing. So, that means this is how you"
3170320,3182720," get, right, the actual index in here. If you know what I mean. If you know what I mean. So,"
3185120,3194320," yeah. We can even maybe have like 100 in here. And yeah. So, that's basically the entirety of the thing."
3194320,3201760," Very interesting, honestly. Very interesting. I think that's the way to go."
3203200,3213760," So, we can even call this as the index, actually. Let me, can I simply copy paste this entire stuff in"
3213760,3220000," there? All right. So, because, yeah, we already have a player index. So, all of that just fits in here."
3220000,3228160," All of that just fits in here. And then, we just use the index. Okay. Well, that's kind of bizarre."
3230240,3236080," It didn't really work that well. Oh, this is because it's looking, it's looking actually here."
3236080,3243680," So, what's the entity? Okay. So, the entity direction, we don't even have to do any of that"
3243680,3248480," stuff in here. So, we just use the player direction and the direction of the entity has"
3248480,3251200," to be in here. I think it kind of worked, didn't it?"
3253680,3259040," Uh, it's kind of hard to tell, but not really."
3259040,3268400," Uh, I feel like it has to be actually looking to this side."
3268400,3272720," I think it has to be looking to this side."
3274240,3278720," Um, what if I, what if I actually add..."
3278720,3286080," Oh, it's, it's, it's, it's went over, over some, some stuff."
3286080,3289920," Um, over some stuff."
3289920,3293760," Uh, that's kind of bizarre. Like, I didn't, I don't know what's up with that."
3293840,3295920," We're almost there, I think."
3295920,3303360," Um, right. So, there's a node test and it's complaining about missing something log console a."
3303360,3306160," Uh, yeah. So, because it's just an index."
3306160,3309200," It's just an index. Okay."
3309200,3312960," So, let's go to here. Let's go to here."
3313760,3316960," So, proper math entity."
3316960,3324560," So, let's decompose some of this stuff, right?"
3324560,3326320," So, let's decompose some of this stuff."
3326320,3335280," So, it's going to be a console, uh, const a like so, uh, const a like so."
3335280,3339440," All right. So, that's what we've got."
3342000,3346000," So, the next thing I did is actually subtracted that."
3346000,3349040," What if I add MathPy?"
3349040,3351760," So, that's going to become bigger."
3351760,3353600," So, it kind of goes over MathPy."
3353600,3355120," What if I do two of them?"
3355120,3360320," So, I feel like one of the things I have to do is..."
3360320,3363600," Uh, after..."
3363600,3366960," Yeah, instead of doing ABS..."
3366960,3371600," Instead of doing ABS, I should have actually done proper mod again."
3372720,3374000," I think that's what I had to do."
3374000,3376800," Yeah."
3376800,3380320," So, when I..."
3380320,3382560," After I subtracted all of them, right?"
3382560,3386000," So, uh, that's what I had to do."
3386000,3388080," This is the index now."
3388080,3390400," Uh-huh."
3390400,3391520," This one is interesting."
3393760,3394480," Mm-hmm."
3394480,3398880," So, this is the value."
3398880,3408640," Let's maybe try to put this thing back in here."
3410160,3411600," This is a proper mod that."
3411600,3412400," Proper mod that."
3412400,3413760," So, A."
3413760,3418240," So, this is the player direction."
3418240,3420080," Then the entity direction."
3420080,3422080," Then that."
3422080,3423200," And then that."
3423200,3423440," Okay."
3424240,3426080," So, that's the value we'll get."
3426080,3427680," And then it goes..."
3427680,3431600," Yeah, it goes from bigger to that one."
3431600,3433360," So, maybe..."
3433360,3436080," What if I actually..."
3436080,3437760," I think I have to swap them around."
3440320,3446640," I think that's what was the problem."
3446640,3448080," Yeah."
3448080,3450320," I think that was the problem."
3450320,3452240," So, this is A."
3453040,3454560," Then this is the value."
3454560,3455840," From that to that."
3455840,3457600," And what's funny..."
3457600,3458960," Is that..."
3458960,3462240," We probably need to do a proper mod..."
3462240,3465040," With the 8."
3465040,3468720," Because this thing can be equal to MathPy."
3468720,3470400," Maybe not."
3470400,3470720," We'll see."
3470720,3471200," We'll see."
3471200,3472880," So, I don't think it's that important."
3472880,3475280," Okay."
3475280,3478160," So, let me put this thing in here."
3478160,3481040," And maybe that's the new index."
3482320,3485760," I think that's the thing."
3485760,3491360," Yeah."
3491360,3493200," All right."
3493200,3494000," So, this is compile."
3494000,3495200," It seems to be compiling."
3495200,3499040," All right."
3499040,3500960," It's looking in the right direction."
3500960,3501520," Holy shit."
3501520,3502320," I think it's working."
3502320,3506160," It's looking towards the wall."
3506160,3508960," It's supposed to look towards the wall."
3512320,3515920," Almost."
3515920,3518960," Ah, okay."
3518960,3521280," Man."
3521280,3523040," Okay."
3523040,3524720," So, it makes sense."
3524720,3527600," I see."
3533040,3533440," Hmm."
3533440,3536080," This is not correct visually."
3536080,3540320," But it is correct from the mathematical point..."
3540320,3542560," From the math that we actually calculate."
3542560,3543440," Okay."
3543440,3545280," Yeah."
3547040,3549920," So, this is the flaw in our logic."
3549920,3551600," Right."
3551600,3560000," It is not enough to just compare the angle between the vectors."
3560720,3562720," Because you can have this kind of situation."
3562720,3566160," So, this thing should actually look here."
3566160,3569520," But it's looking to the side because of how the vectors are computed."
3569520,3574960," So, it's looking straight at us when we are looking straight at it."
3576000,3577040," But, yeah."
3577040,3580720," When you look to the side, it's kind of..."
3580720,3582960," Well, I mean, it's kind of correct in here."
3582960,3588080," It's correct when you're too close to it."
3588080,3591600," I feel like it has to take into account the projection."
3591600,3593120," It has to..."
3593120,3594560," Well, this is correct, actually."
3594560,3594960," Look at that."
3594960,3596800," Look at that."
3596800,3597680," It's actually correct."
3597680,3598640," This is also correct."
3598640,3599280," What the fuck?"
3599280,3604800," Because there is a little bit of a part of the eye in here."
3606320,3606720," Right."
3606720,3613120," So, like, you need to somehow take the projection into account."
3613120,3616720," You kind of need to take the projection into account."
3616720,3618000," So, what I'm thinking is that..."
3618000,3618640," All right."
3618640,3620000," So, I have the following idea."
3620000,3621360," Okay."
3621360,3627520," How can you take the projection into account?"
3627520,3630400," I've got something, by the way."
3636400,3637280," What if..."
3637280,3637600," Okay."
3637600,3639680," Look."
3639680,3643840," What if we take the position of the entity"
3643840,3648560," and project its feet onto the screen?"
3648560,3650800," So, we get the point on the screen."
3650800,3651840," Cool."
3653920,3659520," Then, we offset their position by their direction."
3659520,3661680," By maybe one or something like that."
3661680,3663440," By a certain amount."
3663440,3665680," And we project the new point now."
3665680,3668560," We get another point on the screen."
3668560,3673440," We take a vector of two projected points."
3674400,3678480," And that vector is basically where this entire thing is looking."
3678480,3682560," So, that's how we can take into account the projection."
3684720,3692000," So, that's how we take in the account, like, the projection into account."
3692000,3697440," So, we can try to do it like that."
3697440,3704320," Interesting."
3711760,3712160," All right."
3712160,3714960," Maybe this is what we need to do."
3714960,3718080," Maybe I need to make another break, actually."
3718080,3719520," Maybe I need to make another break."
3719520,3722880," But I'm not 100% sure."
3722880,3730240," ""Direction will be added after getting the angle for rotations."""
3730240,3732000," What are you guys talking about?"
3736800,3755360," Can it be the angle between enemy look direction"
3755360,3760560," and the line between player position and enemy position?"
3765440,3766000," Maybe."
3766000,3767200," Maybe we can try to do that."
3767200,3771280," And, Tiago, in News 33, I think you need to calm down, actually."
3771280,3773200," So, for one hour."
3773200,3780480," There is no need to caps at me, especially when I'm, you know,"
3780480,3785680," doing a very difficult intellectual work while hundreds of people are watching."
3785680,3790000," So, before screaming at me, try to do the same."
3790000,3791920," All right."
3791920,3800960," While, imagine somebody in the chat screaming at you as well."
3800960,3805680," Just to get a sense of what exactly I'm doing on my streams."
3805680,3812480," So, that's an interesting idea."
3812480,3813440," We could try to do that."
3814480,3815440," We could try to do that."
3815440,3818560," Yeah."
3818560,3824800," I'm just screaming on the screen, but you can't hear it."
3824800,3825760," Yeah."
3828800,3830240," Rest in peace, random guy."
3830240,3837360," Well, I mean, if they're a reasonable person, they will understand what I'm saying."
3837360,3840400," And they will be back, but as a different person."
3841280,3846480," So, actually, trying to think good of people, right?"
3846480,3852560," So, maybe they just don't understand what it is to actually stream in front of hundreds of people"
3852560,3855280," while doing a difficult intellectual work."
3855280,3856960," They maybe never experienced that."
3856960,3859120," So, like, you need to be polite."
3859120,3861600," You need to explain to them what it is, right?"
3861600,3863200," So, it's actually kind of difficult."
3863200,3866800," We need to have a full focus, right?"
3866800,3868720," So, anyway."
3868720,3870400," So, and that's why I timed them out, right?"
3870400,3873280," So, I gave them time to think about their behavior."
3873280,3876000," So, that's an interesting idea."
3876000,3878560," So, just basically, yeah, let's go ahead and do that."
3878560,3881840," So, we can have angle."
3881840,3885040," So, that means we need to take the player position, right?"
3885040,3889040," That means we need to have the entity position."
3889040,3889360," Okay."
3889360,3892480," So, entity, entity position."
3893360,3898160," So, at the right now, the entity's position is simply that."
3898160,3900480," Entity position."
3900480,3911520," So, and after that, essentially,"
3911520,3918240," we need to take the entity position, but we'll have to clone it, right?"
3918240,3919360," So, we'll have to clone it."
3920400,3924400," Then, we have to subtract the player position."
3924400,3925200," Player position."
3925200,3927040," Let's get that."
3927040,3928480," And we need to take an angle."
3928480,3932000," And I wonder if I even have"
3932000,3935520," this stuff."
3935520,3940560," So, vector 2, so set angle."
3940560,3945840," So, do we even use A10, A10, 2?"
3945840,3948480," No, no, we don't even have A10, 2 anywhere."
3948480,3953040," So, what we can do, we can just introduce a method that takes an angle."
3954640,3955920," So, this is a vector 2."
3955920,3958720," We have a length, though."
3958720,3960400," So, I think it's kind of related to that."
3960400,3962400," So, this is an angle and gives a number."
3962400,3967680," And the angle is simply A10, 2, electric boogaloo."
3969040,3970400," So, Y, X."
3970400,3973680," So, that's how it basically works."
3973680,3980000," So, for those who don't know, like, this is how you take the angle between two,"
3980000,3983040," like, for a certain vector."
3983040,3984400," What's the angle of a certain vector?"
3984400,3985600," That's how you do that."
3985600,3988080," So, A10, 2, and you have to provide Y and X."
3988960,3993920," So, the reason why you have to do that is because, actually, mathematically,"
3993920,3998320," you need to sort of, like, take a slope of your vector."
3998320,4002800," And slope of your vector is actually Y divided by X."
4002800,4006400," And you take an arctang of that thing."
4006400,4007920," And that's how you compute a vector."
4007920,4014480," But then there's a whole problem with signs going on when you are in a certain quadrant."
4014480,4018560," So, they introduced A10, 2 to fix all of that."
4018960,4023440," But you can only fix all of that if you know the specific coordinates in here."
4023440,4028160," So, what they did is that they forced you to actually pass the coordinates separately."
4028160,4029200," Right."
4029200,4034240," So, and the reason why they accept Y as a first and X as a second,"
4034240,4041120," so then it is easier for you mechanically to switch from A10 to A10, 2,"
4041120,4043840," and replace a slash with a comma."
4045760,4047920," So, this is kind of weird."
4047920,4052400," But this is the reason, like, why A10, 2 is so weird."
4052400,4052640," Right."
4052640,4056560," Because it's kind of mimicking the original thing that you want to do mathematically."
4056560,4060560," But it's a new version that kind of fixes some of the problems with sign and everything."
4060560,4062400," And it needs the specific coordinates."
4062400,4065520," So, you have to, you know, like, pass it like that."
4065520,4068720," So, and you can kind of, like, visually compare them."
4068720,4068880," Right."
4068880,4070640," So, you can kind of visually compare them."
4070640,4072160," Right."
4072160,4073440," So, you see what I'm talking about?"
4073440,4077360," So, it's kind of funny, actually."
4077360,4078480," It's kind of funny."
4078480,4080560," But nobody remembers all of that, right?"
4080560,4083760," Because everyone just automatically uses A10, 2, right?"
4083760,4085440," So, because that's a better version anyway."
4086240,4092320," So, I'm waiting for A10, 3, where they finally fixed the order of these things."
4092320,4096240," Like, maybe it's legacy."
4096240,4099280," But this is just, like, actually my hypothesis why it is like that."
4099280,4100880," So, anyway."
4100880,4103840," So, this is the angle."
4103840,4110160," And yeah, we can probably even just do some stuff like that."
4110160,4112240," So, that's..."
4112240,4121200," I suppose, my friend, I suppose..."
4121200,4124240," So, this is entity direction."
4132160,4134560," So, we're trying to find an angle between..."
4134560,4135600," Yeah."
4135600,4136960," Between these two things."
4136960,4138560," Okay."
4138560,4143120," Okay."
4143120,4144720," So, we don't use this stuff anyway."
4144720,4148880," So, the fact that I have A in here kind of confused me."
4148880,4149520," So, for a second."
4149520,4150800," So, I really apologize for that."
4150800,4154320," So, instead of player, we have to just use that, I suppose."
4154320,4156080," And..."
4156080,4157920," Oh, that's annoying, chat."
4157920,4161680," That is extremely annoying because that breaks all of the logic"
4161680,4163520," that I build up in here."
4163520,4165840," That breaks all of the logic."
4165840,4167920," So, I have to start over because now..."
4167920,4169680," Right."
4169680,4172800," So, when I'm looking..."
4172800,4175040," So, I don't have to shift anything anymore."
4175040,4177360," That's basically what we have in here."
4177360,4178640," So, I don't have to shift anything."
4178640,4184400," I could maybe get rid of this thing."
4185760,4186160," All right."
4186160,4187840," So, I can get rid of this thing."
4187840,4192000," So, here is the proper mode for entity direction."
4192000,4194800," Here is the mode for this thing."
4194800,4196640," So, we're just subtracting the syntax stuff."
4196640,4198480," But then, we take a mode again."
4198480,4201520," Then, we're renormalizing things and so on and so forth."
4202080,4202480," All right."
4202480,4204640," So, yeah."
4204640,4207120," And that's about it."
4207120,4209200," And we don't even need the player direction anymore"
4209200,4211760," because it's kind of taken into account in here."
4211760,4213120," All right."
4213120,4215920," So, let's see if that changes anything."
4215920,4217680," So, I'm actually kind of curious."
4217680,4223920," It's broken because 949."
4223920,4224960," Oh, yeah."
4224960,4226720," We're trying to print this entire thing."
4226720,4227360," Okay."
4227360,4228080," So, that's why."
4228080,4230480," All right."
4230480,4232240," Yeah."
4232240,4232800," It's broken."
4232800,4239040," It's not looking correctly at all."
4240160,4246160," Though, that is kind of sus, honestly."
4246160,4247520," Right."
4247520,4250080," So, the entity is supposed to..."
4250080,4256800," So, what if I swap them around?"
4256800,4260560," What if I swap them around?"
4260560,4261440," Right."
4261440,4266640," So, yeah."
4266640,4268000," It's not correct."
4268000,4268800," So, I need to..."
4268800,4279600," So, I don't..."
4279600,4280320," Where is it looking?"
4280320,4282240," Where is it looking?"
4282240,4284000," Yeah."
4284000,4285840," So, I need to rethink the whole thing."
4285840,4286080," Right."
4286080,4293760," So, I need to reimagine how the angles map to specific indices and stuff like that."
4293760,4295280," Like, I need to reimagine that."
4295280,4301440," Because switching to a different paradigm completely broken the entire model that I have in my head."
4301440,4302480," Right."
4302480,4303440," So, yeah."
4303440,4304880," So, we probably need to make a small break."
4304880,4310160," And after the small break, when I make another cup of tea, we can continue actually doing all that."
4310160,4310480," Okay."
4310480,4311920," Okay."
4311920,4316320," So, I just realized that we don't really have to do anything much."
4316320,4320320," We can just swap around how we subtract."
4320320,4320480," Right."
4320480,4324560," So, right now, I'm subtracting player from the entity."
4324560,4326960," So, which kind of switches the direction of the vector."
4326960,4329440," So, we have to do the opposite from the player."
4329440,4332560," And that will..."
4332560,4335280," Or will it, actually?"
4335280,4336400," Or will it?"
4336400,4337760," That's kind of bizarre."
4337760,4343440," So, maybe it was already fine."
4343440,4345040," Maybe it was already fine."
4348320,4349520," So, this is the entity."
4349520,4360560," So, this is the old code based purely on the angles between the entity and the player."
4361440,4362320," Right."
4362320,4363600," So, entity instance player."
4363600,4364800," And this is what we do."
4364800,4368400," So, I could..."
4368400,4375280," I'm not sure."
4375280,4378080," I think I'm doing the correct thing."
4378080,4382560," So, if I'm subtracting the player's position from the entity position,"
4382560,4385040," I'm having a vector that..."
4385040,4386880," Yeah."
4386880,4389680," So, that looks towards the entity."
4389680,4390000," Right."
4390000,4392080," So, that's correct, actually."
4392080,4393760," That's correct."
4393760,4396400," So, then I do that one."
4396400,4398880," And, right."
4398880,4404000," So, then, afterwards, I'm subtracting 180."
4404000,4407040," I'm subtracting 180."
4407040,4409760," And that's exactly..."
4409760,4410880," Oh."
4410880,4415840," And because of that, I have to actually do..."
4415840,4417600," Yeah."
4417600,4418720," Come on."
4419440,4421440," I actually have to do it like that."
4421440,4423120," Right."
4423120,4424720," So, this is the entity direction."
4424720,4428400," This is sort of like reminiscent of the player direction."
4428400,4434080," But it's a player direction with respect to the position of the player in the entity position."
4434080,4434320," Right."
4434320,4440960," So, and after that, we're subtracting this one to take into account some shifts and everything."
4440960,4443360," Because this is how we rendered the sprites."
4443360,4445920," And then, right."
4445920,4448080," So, we're also normalizing the whole thing."
4448080,4449280," Right."
4449280,4455280," So, that more or less corresponds to my mental model that I have in my head."
4455280,4456160," Right."
4456160,4457040," So, hopefully."
4457040,4457760," Yeah."
4457760,4458720," And it's looking at us."
4458720,4458960," Okay."
4458960,4459760," So, that's perfect."
4459760,4463680," And that fixes the problem that we had."
4463680,4465200," Okay."
4465200,4466400," So, that's nice."
4466400,4466880," All right."
4466880,4473600," So, thank you so much to the person in the chat who pointed that out."
4474160,4478400," Next time, please say all of that calmly."
4478400,4480480," There's no need to caps at me."
4480480,4484480," Especially because I'm streaming for hundreds of people."
4484480,4485360," It's already hard."
4485360,4487600," I have to pay attention to a lot of things."
4487600,4487840," All right."
4487840,4488720," So, that works."
4488720,4489600," So, that's actually pretty cool."
4489600,4490240," I really like that."
4490240,4493120," That's nice."
4493120,4494640," Okay."
4494640,4495600," Well, it's almost."
4495600,4497120," It's not entirely right."
4497120,4499920," So, there's some weird situations."
4500720,4507920," Can I maybe reduce the resolution, so to speak?"
4507920,4509200," The resolution, so to speak."
4509200,4510160," So, this is the factor."
4510160,4512400," Let's actually make it factor maybe something like 20."
4512400,4514720," Yep."
4514720,4517200," Could you refresh?"
4517200,4520000," Yo."
4520000,4524720," So, the resolution is lower, but hopefully this entire thing is faster."
4524720,4526080," Yo."
4526080,4527120," Look at that chat."
4527120,4528320," Look at that chat."
4528320,4529440," Isn't that a poggers?"
4530160,4531440," Isn't that a poggers?"
4531440,4533440," I think it is pretty freaking poggers."
4533440,4536400," Right."
4536400,4539200," I think that's pretty fucking poggers, mate."
4539200,4542080," It's pretty fucking poggers."
4542080,4545120," It's a little bit weird that it's not entirely."
4545120,4547280," Yeah."
4547280,4548240," Let me see."
4548240,4552000," There's some fucky wackiness going on."
4552000,4552800," Not gonna lie."
4552800,4555040," Fucky wackiness."
4555040,4559120," So, maybe there should be some sort of an offset if we think about that."
4559920,4560240," Right."
4560240,4561200," If we think about that."
4561200,4562960," Because."
4562960,4565680," Maybe I need to start my paint."
4565680,4566480," Right."
4566480,4573440," So, because it has to be some sort of like a range."
4573440,4581440," Maybe we have to subtract like eighth of a pie."
4582000,4582240," Right."
4582240,4584480," Or maybe add the eighth of a pie."
4584480,4585840," Right."
4585840,4587440," Because we have to kind of like."
4587440,4589760," Yeah."
4589760,4592080," Do the thing."
4592080,4593360," Just a second."
4593360,4593600," Right."
4593600,4595520," So, we need to adjust for those things."
4595520,4597920," We need to adjust for those things."
4601120,4601920," Right."
4601920,4603120," So, where is the."
4603120,4605360," It's that stuff."
4605360,4607040," Right."
4607040,4610080," Not really eighth of a pie."
4610080,4612240," So, fourth of a pie is more like."
4612240,4614640," Ninety degrees."
4614640,4617840," So, it has to be."
4617840,4619120," Yeah."
4619120,4620960," It has to be like maybe 16 or something."
4622160,4624160," So, it should look."
4624160,4626960," That."
4626960,4629840," So, if we just offset."
4629840,4633680," The angle of the."
4633680,4637360," I'm not even sure which angle should we offset."
4637360,4638400," Like it doesn't really matter."
4638400,4639360," It's like one of them."
4639360,4641760," It's actually one of them."
4641760,4644160," Let me see."
4644160,4645200," Let me see."
4645200,4646000," Let me see."
4646000,4646800," So, we can."
4646800,4648560," Maybe."
4648560,4651280," Add math pie."
4651280,4654320," So, a for."
4654320,4655600," So, it's more like eighth."
4655600,4655840," Right."
4655840,4656560," So, eighth of a pie."
4656560,4657440," So, maybe subtract."
4657440,4657920," Or maybe."
4657920,4660160," Or maybe."
4660160,4662560," Add."
4662560,4663840," Not sure which one."
4663840,4665440," Which one is going to be better."
4665440,4666960," Okay."
4666960,4668000," So, it's probably add."
4668400,4669200," Has to be added."
4669200,4671040," So."
4671040,4673840," Let me see."
4673840,4674080," It's."
4674080,4674800," It's all."
4674800,4675200," Honestly."
4675200,4676720," It's already more like details."
4676720,4677840," Yeah."
4677840,4678080," Okay."
4678080,4680560," And now."
4680560,4681040," If I."
4681040,4682080," Yeah."
4682080,4682320," Now."
4682320,4682560," It's."
4682560,4683120," It's correct."
4683120,4683440," Okay."
4683440,4684240," So, I'm really happy."
4684240,4686560," So, I think we adjusted all of these things more."
4686560,4687040," Oh my god."
4687040,4688000," This is actually perfect."
4688000,4688320," Yeah."
4688320,4690800," There we go."
4690800,4691440," There we go."
4691440,4692160," So, that's pretty cool."
4692160,4694720," So, we just had to like."
4694720,4696160," You know."
4696160,4697040," Adjust it a little bit."
4697040,4698320," So, it's within the ranges."
4698320,4698480," See."
4698480,4699360," If that makes any sense."
4699360,4700640," I don't really know how to explain that."
4700640,4701520," Yo."
4701520,4701840," That's."
4701840,4702800," That's ideal."
4702800,4704960," That is actually ideal."
4704960,4705680," I really like that."
4705680,4707920," Uh."
4707920,4708720," Okay."
4708720,4710000," So, we can move around."
4710000,4711920," And."
4711920,4712240," Yeah."
4712240,4714240," Nice."
4717040,4722480," So, maybe we can now factor out all of these things into their own entities."
4722480,4723280," Because look at that."
4723280,4724400," You have entity position."
4724400,4725600," You have entity direction."
4725600,4727920," You can essentially maybe factor that out."
4727920,4729200," Who said you can't do that?"
4729200,4730480," Right."
4730480,4731360," So, today."
4731360,4731920," Yeah."
4731920,4735280," So, you can have something like interface entity."
4735280,4735840," Right."
4735840,4736800," Interface entity."
4736800,4739520," And basically, it has a position and direction."
4739520,4741440," Position."
4741440,4743120," It's going to be number."
4743120,4745600," And direction."
4745600,4747440," It's going to be number as well."
4747440,4747760," Right."
4747760,4750080," So, position and done number."
4750080,4756800," I think player actually conforms to this thing."
4756800,4756960," Right."
4756960,4759360," So, it has a position and it has a direction."
4759360,4759680," Right."
4759680,4762000," So, that means I will be able to pass."
4762000,4764560," If there is a function that accepts entity."
4764560,4767840," I will be able to pass player there as well."
4767840,4768080," Right."
4768080,4769120," So, that's kind of nice."
4769120,4772000," So, you can have this kind of stuff."
4772000,4772640," So, maybe."
4772640,4777360," Maybe we can factor this entire thing out."
4778240,4779440," Into a separate function."
4779440,4781600," Not really sure how to call that."
4781600,4782880," So, let's call it."
4782880,4785760," I don't know."
4785760,4786480," Let's call it full."
4786480,4790000," So, here we have an entity one."
4790000,4790400," Right."
4790400,4790960," So, maybe."
4790960,4793760," Let's call it a player."
4793760,4793920," Right."
4793920,4795040," So, it's going to be entity."
4795040,4797760," And entity."
4797760,4798640," Right."
4798640,4800560," So, something like entity."
4800560,4804800," So, like player is an entity because the player interface can be passed in here."
4804800,4805040," Right."
4805040,4807920," So, because entity is sort of like a subset of the player."
4807920,4811200," And in here we're supposed to return a number."
4811200,4816400," On top of that, we want to actually provide the sprite count."
4816400,4816640," Right."
4816640,4818240," So, it's more like a sprite count."
4818240,4821760," Though, for all of the..."
4821760,4824560," We're always going to have eight sprites anyway."
4824560,4828800," So, I don't really plan to have more angles for the entities to be fair."
4829680,4830000," Right."
4830000,4833120," So, I think eight is going to be sort of like a standard."
4833120,4834320," All right."
4834320,4836720," So, I think eight is going to be sort of like a stand."
4836720,4838160," Okay."
4838160,4844160," So, now what we have in here."
4844160,4846960," So, we probably want to return the whole thing."
4847680,4848960," So, entity direction."
4848960,4850720," Entity direction."
4850720,4851760," Entity direction."
4851760,4852160," So, then..."
4852160,4855680," So, entity position."
4855680,4858240," So, it's this position."
4858240,4860880," And we're subtracting the player's position."
4860880,4862320," Yeah."
4862320,4865200," So, maybe it would make sense to actually factor out eight."
4866320,4866800," All right."
4866800,4869120," So, how can we call it?"
4869120,4872560," Sprite angles count."
4872560,4873600," It's going to be eight."
4873600,4875360," Right."
4875360,4876880," So, uh-huh."
4876880,4881120," Sprite angles count."
4881120,4882720," And eight in here..."
4882720,4884320," I don't know."
4884320,4886800," I think we can just hard code this entire stuff."
4886800,4890800," I think we can just hard code this entire stuff."
4891920,4892560," Right."
4892560,4896560," So, sprite angle index."
4896560,4897360," That's a good name."
4897360,4899600," That's a good name, chat."
4899600,4900720," Actually, good name."
4900720,4904160," So, let's create an entity."
4904160,4909120," And that entity is going to have this specific position."
4909120,4909360," Right."
4909360,4911280," So, it's going to have this specific position."
4911280,4912560," This specific direction."
4912560,4914240," Uh-huh."
4914240,4915280," So, that's pretty cool."
4915280,4917360," That's the entity."
4917360,4919920," And as an index,"
4920400,4922880," we're going to do the following thing."
4922880,4925040," So, let me grab this entire function."
4925040,4926720," Let's grab this entire function."
4926720,4928880," And put it in here."
4928880,4930640," Uh-huh."
4930640,4931680," That's cool."
4931680,4933680," So, the player is game player."
4933680,4935280," So, does it work?"
4935280,4936240," Yeah, it does work."
4936240,4940160," Because again, player is just like a super interface of entity."
4940160,4942880," And an entity in here is just that."
4942880,4945600," So, and then we have to provide the entity position."
4945600,4949280," Well, it complains about something in here."
4949920,4950720," Is not as sad."
4950720,4955440," No."
4955440,4959040," Like, I thought I understand how the type system of TypeScript works."
4959040,4960080," Apparently, I do not."
4960080,4960880," So."
4960880,4974800," It's kind of funny how like Slavs, pretty much any Slav can understand what I just said."
4975680,4980880," So, for any Slav, it's just like, I think I used all the Slavic words."
4980880,4981920," Right."
4987120,4988960," It's like an inter-Slavic thing."
4988960,4991440," But it's Slavic indeed."
4991440,4991680," Yeah."
5000400,5001120," W-Vetra."
5001120,5001120," W-Vetra."
5001120,5001120," W-Vetra."
5001120,5006080," All the Slavic words."
5006080,5007120," All the Slavic words."
5007120,5009920," So, entity position."
5009920,5010160," Okay."
5010160,5013600," So, how can I fucking fix that, my friend?"
5013600,5020320," I can explicitly say that player extends the entity interface."
5020320,5021440," Is that a good idea, chat?"
5021440,5022800," Is that a good idea, like this thing?"
5022800,5025280," Right."
5025280,5026720," It's like extends."
5026720,5031920," So, extends entity."
5031920,5033520," Makes sense to me."
5036560,5037360," Oh, fuck."
5037360,5037600," Okay."
5037600,5038240," That explains."
5038240,5039680," Okay."
5039680,5042000," So, it doesn't have to extend anything."
5042000,5043520," All right."
5043520,5044560," All right."
5044560,5044880," All right."
5044880,5045520," All right."
5045520,5046720," So, now it works."
5046720,5049840," So, it means I did, in fact, understand how this thing works."
5049840,5052560," I did, in fact, understand."
5052560,5054240," Okay."
5054240,5054880," So, that's pretty cool."
5054880,5059600," Now, what can I do in here?"
5061920,5062880," That's very cool."
5062880,5066640," I can even factor that shit out further."
5066640,5067520," Right."
5067520,5069760," For example, if I want to have several entities."
5069760,5071600," Right."
5071600,5075760," So, we can do something like render entity."
5075760,5079040," Let's call it render enemy."
5079040,5079680," Right."
5079680,5080720," So, render enemy."
5080720,5083680," And here, enemy is an entity."
5083680,5088160," And it has a certain position and stuff like that."
5088960,5090960," So, I can now."
5090960,5092160," Oh, yeah."
5092160,5093520," This one is very interesting."
5093520,5097440," So, that means we'll have to pass the player to actually render it properly."
5097440,5097760," Yeah."
5097760,5100080," So, we'll have to pass the sprite pool."
5100080,5102320," Let's actually pass the entirety of the game in here."
5102320,5103360," All right."
5103360,5105440," So, we pass the entirety of the game."
5105440,5108640," And here is an enemy."
5108640,5109200," Like so."
5109200,5110960," Right."
5110960,5112720," So, render enemy."
5112720,5115680," Entity."
5116320,5118320," So, and now, what that means."
5118320,5121680," I can have two entities."
5121680,5121920," Right."
5121920,5123440," So, I have entity one."
5123440,5125120," I can create another one."
5125120,5125440," Right."
5125440,5127120," So, I don't freaking know."
5127120,5130240," I can take, create entity two."
5130240,5131280," Right."
5131280,5137920," That one, in terms of x, will be placed nearby, by x."
5137920,5140400," And looking in an opposite direction, maybe."
5140400,5141360," So, math pi."
5141360,5142160," So, kind of this."
5142160,5144160," And then I can just render this thing."
5144160,5147520," Furthermore, I can move them into array."
5147520,5147680," Right."
5147680,5150960," So, who said I can't, like, create an array out of this entire stuff?"
5150960,5151280," I can."
5151280,5152640," Right."
5152640,5154400," So, I can say entities."
5154400,5154640," Right."
5154640,5156320," So, this is entities."
5156320,5157680," Like so."
5157680,5160480," So, and let's do it like that."
5160480,5161040," There we go."
5161040,5165840," Might as well maybe put additional lines in here."
5166640,5167440," Right."
5167440,5168720," So, these are additional lines."
5168720,5172560," So, now I can do something like entity of entities."
5172560,5174720," Entities."
5174720,5177200," About some entities."
5177200,5181920," So, now I can add more and more entities."
5181920,5183520," And they're going to be rendered correctly."
5183520,5186720," Their sprites are going to be actually completed correctly."
5186720,5187600," And stuff like that."
5187600,5188560," They're looking at each other."
5188560,5190400," It's a face off."
5190400,5192000," Oh, yeah."
5192000,5192800," That's so fucking cool."
5192800,5193440," I love that."
5193440,5194640," Oh, my God."
5194640,5196000," They're looking at each other."
5196000,5197040," You can clearly see that."
5197040,5198640," Oh, my God."
5198640,5199360," I love that."
5199360,5202480," That's so cool."
5202480,5205280," That's what they're literally looking."
5205280,5206480," And this is not a 3D."
5206480,5208560," Look, this is a pseudo 3D."
5208560,5209120," Right."
5209120,5210880," This is a fucking pseudo 3D."
5210880,5213440," And it makes sense, right?"
5213440,5215120," So, they're just like looking at each other."
5215120,5216800," So romantic."
5216800,5220000," Uh, yep."
5220000,5221280," Yep."
5221280,5222400," They're looking at each other."
5222400,5224000," Damn, bro."
5224640,5228480," They make them spin."
5228480,5229440," I could maybe."
5229440,5231760," So, I could just like..."
5231760,5234320," Okay."
5234320,5235600," So, I can just do time."
5235600,5237360," All right."
5237360,5237920," And that's it."
5237920,5246240," I can make it like spin twice as fast."
5249200,5249520," Yeah."
5249520,5249520," Yeah."
5249520,5253920," Like, this one is..."
5253920,5254960," Looking at this one is just like..."
5254960,5256160," What the fuck are you doing?"
5256160,5257200," Like, are you okay?"
5257200,5259920," It's like me and my brother."
5259920,5263920," Um, all right."
5263920,5265920," So, what about like maybe 16?"
5265920,5266480," So, they're gonna go..."
5268080,5268640," Are you gonna go..."
5268640,5275520," That's so cool."
5275520,5276160," I really like that."
5276160,5280080," Boom."
5280080,5285440," Damn."
5285440,5286240," Can I add more?"
5286880,5290720," What if I actually take that one?"
5290720,5294720," And now I wanna add it on y-axis."
5294720,5297680," All right."
5297680,5299280," So, that's another one."
5299280,5303200," So, let's make all of them look at that one."
5303200,5305440," So, this is has to be like a 90 degrees."
5305440,5309680," It's looking in the wrong direction."
5309680,5311680," So, what about negative one then?"
5311680,5313760," Yeah."
5313760,5318240," So, they are observing malfunctioning robots."
5318240,5323760," Why is this so fucking funny?"
5323760,5324080," It's just..."
5328720,5337520," Can you move it up and down?"
5337520,5340640," I wonder if I can specify..."
5340640,5341040," Okay."
5341040,5345840," So, can I specify the size of the entity, honestly?"
5345840,5348800," I think I can."
5348800,5349840," All right."
5349840,5352320," So, if I add an additional size in here,"
5352320,5357360," it's still part of the interface, right?"
5357360,5358720," So, it's called scale, right?"
5358720,5359760," So, the scale one."
5359760,5366160," So, I feel like I need to introduce like an enemy interface."
5366160,5367360," Interface enemy."
5367360,5370240," It extends entity, right?"
5370240,5372720," And it just creates a scale."
5372720,5373840," All of that will go away."
5373840,5375520," So, this is like a temporary code."
5375520,5378000," So, enemy, right?"
5378000,5382640," And the reason why I wanna have that is because now I wanna specify the scale."
5382640,5385360," So, the scale is this one."
5385360,5387840," So, enemy scale, right?"
5387840,5388880," So, this is the scale."
5388880,5391520," And here, this is one."
5391520,5394000," And I want to make it go up and down."
5394000,5396240," We need to make it maybe slightly smaller."
5396240,5399440," Something went wrong, yeah."
5406880,5407680," Okay."
5407680,5410160," So, what if we introduce z axis for this thing?"
5410160,5412560," Right."
5412560,5418080," So, originally, z for all of these things is one, right?"
5418080,5419360," So, this is one."
5419360,5421600," And it's actually made them one and one."
5421600,5423760," Okay."
5423760,5427760," So, now I can do something like enemy z."
5428640,5429200," All right."
5429200,5430880," So, is it working?"
5430880,5434160," Okay."
5434160,5439840," By the way, I think you need to bring back the angle of the player."
5439840,5443360," The initial angle of the player because this is a little bit annoying."
5443360,5445600," What was the initial angle of the player?"
5445600,5446880," Does anybody remember?"
5446880,5447760," Yeah, here it is."
5447760,5449440," This is where I did the modification."
5449440,5450080," Okay, that's cool."
5450960,5452560," So, now, chat."
5452560,5461520," So, what we want to do, we actually want to move from zero to one, right?"
5461520,5463200," So, let's actually move from zero to one."
5463200,5473200," So, if you have sine over time, you actually move from minus one to one, right?"
5473200,5474640," So, which is not what we want."
5474640,5478320," If we add one, we move from zero to two."
5478320,5480960," So, we offset minus one to one to zero to two."
5480960,5483200," So, but this is not what we want."
5483200,5485920," We want to actually move from zero to one."
5485920,5487360," So, we divide it by that."
5487360,5490480," So, and that will make it move like from zero to one."
5490480,5496320," But I think it will go actually below the, what?"
5496320,5500240," Below the floor, right?"
5500240,5501840," But we can fix that a little bit later."
5501840,5504080," So, okay."
5504080,5504880," So, that's working."
5504880,5507360," And it actually goes below the floor, as you can see."
5508000,5508320," Right."
5508320,5511840," So, and it needs to be as fast as it's rotating."
5511840,5514000," So, we have to multiply by 16."
5514000,5520160," Maybe this 16 has to be the factor."
5520160,5522240," Let's call it something like a crazy factor."
5522240,5524960," Crazy factor 16, right?"
5524960,5526400," So, and let's actually do it like that."
5526400,5526960," Crazy."
5526960,5535120," So, something like that."
5535120,5538240," So, and maybe we have to calm it down a little bit."
5538240,5539360," So, how about 10?"
5540320,5542480," Yeah, didn't I save it."
5542480,5544560," Yeah, didn't I save it?"
5544560,5544800," Yeah."
5544800,5547040," Yeah, that's a little bit better."
5547040,5550480," So, yeah."
5550480,5552960," We need to actually limit the whole thing."
5553600,5560800," so, how can I Lerp from actually half?"
5560800,5562000," Oh, I see, I see, I see."
5562000,5565920," So, we need to multiply it by half."
5565920,5567840," So, now it's from zero to half."
5567840,5569760," But then we have to offset it by half."
5569760,5572080," So, it's from half to one, half to one."
5572080,5574160," And that way, it is not going to..."
5574160,5576240," Yeah."
5576240,5576800," There we go."
5577520,5579520," As you can see, it's just like jumping around."
5579520,5585760," All right."
5585760,5586560," That's actually cute."
5586560,5591760," This is so funny."
5591760,5592240," I love that."
5592240,5593600," I fucking love that."
5593600,5594960," So, as you can see, we can..."
5594960,5598640," It's like a child and parents."
5598640,5602960," So, this is the scale."
5602960,5606400," But what we want to do, actually, I think,"
5606960,5612000," is maybe factor out the scale to here."
5612000,5613440," So, now this is the scale."
5613440,5616800," So, I can even do it like that."
5616800,5617040," Right."
5617040,5618080," So, this is the scale."
5618080,5620240," And the offset is the scale."
5620240,5627280," But here, this has to be sort of like a one minus scale."
5627280,5629840," Yeah, it has to be one minus scale."
5629840,5636400," So, that will allow me to maybe make it"
5636400,5637200," a little bit bigger."
5637200,5638560," All right."
5638560,5639360," So, let's go."
5639360,5640720," So, now it's a little bit bigger."
5640720,5642880," Yeah."
5642880,5648640," A little bit."
5648640,5650240," So, there is a bomb here."
5650240,5650480," Right."
5650480,5653040," So, maybe I want to offset that bomb a little bit."
5653040,5655120," So, create the game."
5656080,5657280," Where is the bomb."
5657280,5660160," So, in terms of like..."
5660160,5662080," I think it's x."
5662080,5663760," So, if I put it like 3."
5663760,5664320," Right."
5664320,5666960," Where is it now?"
5666960,5667280," Yeah."
5667280,5668480," So, that's a little bit better."
5668480,5670640," So, that's going to be the scene for now."
5670640,5671680," That's going to be the scene."
5671680,5683920," So, I suppose we can say that we successfully implemented the, you know, mapping of the direction of the entity and the direction of the player to the corresponding sprite."
5683920,5688400," So, this system seems to be working really nicely."
5688400,5689680," I really like how it works."
5689680,5691600," So, yeah."
5691600,5692880," That's perfect."
5692880,5694720," By the way."
5694720,5699520," And maybe the entities have to be actually slightly smaller than one."
5699520,5701600," And that will enable us to actually have jump."
5701600,5704000," Like this, for instance."
5704000,5706000," Because that's kind of cool."
5706000,5706240," Right."
5706240,5707680," So, being able to jump and shit."
5707680,5713360," Look at them."
5713360,5718960," This is like, what?"
5722640,5723040," All right."
5723040,5724720," So, let's do a commit."
5724720,5725920," Let's do a commit."
5725920,5729120," What are we going to say in here, chat?"
5729120,5730160," So, what are we going to say?"
5730160,5731440," What are we going to say now?"
5731440,5732160," What are we going to say?"
5732160,5733200," What are we going to say now?"
5733200,5735440," Right."
5735440,5736000," Stay away."
5736000,5736800," Yeah, exactly."
5736800,5738880," This is like, it's none of your business."
5738880,5740240," Stay away."
5740240,5742320," None of your fucking business."
5742320,5744000," It's only between us."
5745920,5746480," Stay away."
5746480,5748240," Don't."
5748240,5749840," Fucking don't."
5749840,5750080," Okay."
5750080,5752800," All right."
5752800,5755040," So, what was going to be the commit message?"
5755040,5758240," I need an AI that does the summary of what I did."
5758240,5759280," And then the commit message."
5759280,5769680," So, I really feel like Tony missed his calling for 90 strip rap battle beatbox."
5769680,5771120," So, he could have done great."
5771120,5772800," Here's the thing about beatboxing."
5772800,5775440," It comes and goes in waves."
5776480,5780560," So, 10 years ago, there was a new wave of beatboxing."
5780560,5783600," And this is where I actually joined in and started to learn."
5783600,5787040," So, like 10 years ago, beatboxing was like another wave of it."
5787040,5788000," And then it went away."
5788000,5791280," I expect maybe at some point it's going to get back."
5791280,5796480," So, it's constantly like, appears and disappears all the time."
5796480,5800640," It's just like people rediscover it, then get bored of it,"
5800640,5803280," then forget about it, and rediscover it again."
5804960,5806960," So, I'm not really worried about it."
5806960,5808400," Like, beatboxing is actually really cool."
5808400,5811200," It is actually really cool."
5811200,5812640," It's really fun."
5812640,5817280," So, and I really recommend for anyone to learn it."
5817280,5819040," And there's a lot of tutorials on YouTube."
5819040,5822640," Like, literally just go to YouTube and just search like beatbox tutorials."
5822640,5825920," And there's a lot of cool people who can explain you how to do that."
5827120,5827600," So, yeah."
5827600,5831520," It's cool because it's an instrument that is always with you."
5831520,5833120," Right."
5833120,5834640," It's always with you."
5834640,5836240," So, you don't have to bring it with you."
5836240,5837280," It's just like, it's there."
5837280,5841840," So, if you want to have some fun, you can start doing it right here."
5844480,5845520," So, yeah."
5845520,5846400," What we're going to do in here?"
5846400,5848400," Implement."
5848400,5852240," So, I don't freaking know how to do that."
5852240,5853280," So,"
5853280,5857600," Sprite angle."
5859120,5859440," Okay."
5859440,5863120," Implement Sprite angle index mapping."
5863120,5864160," Right."
5864160,5866160," BeardyMan."
5866160,5867360," So, people know him."
5867360,5867680," Yeah."
5867680,5870800," So, BeardyMan was fought not so long ago."
5870800,5872320," I think roughly 10 years ago."
5872320,5874880," BeardyMan is a fucking genius."
5874880,5876160," I'm telling you."
5876160,5880320," He actually kind of revolutionized the whole thing with his setup."
5880320,5886560," So, the level of experimentation he did with different like loopers and recorders"
5886560,5890000," and effects on the fly is fucking insane."
5890000,5895200," And the fact that he can improvise on the fly is just holy fuck."
5895200,5897600," This person is on a completely different level."
5897600,5902640," Anyway."
5902640,5903520," So, I'm going to push that."
5903520,5905440," And I'm going to push that."
5905440,5907440," And so, yeah."
5907440,5913360," We have a way to render entities, render players that look at different directions,"
5913360,5916960," which is already enough for us to introduce multiplayer."
5916960,5921040," And this is exactly what we're going to be doing already on the next"
5921040,5924080," recreation programming session with Amistazosi."
5924080,5926240," So, that's it for today."
5926240,5928480," Thanks everyone who's watching right now."
5928480,5929760," I really appreciate that."
5929760,5933440," Thank you for all these subs, resubs, recommitments and stuff like that."
5933440,5935600," Let's actually take a look at them."
5935600,5936640," So, Torgo7."
5936640,5937440," Thank you so much."
5937440,5938720," And Yonktootoa."
5938720,5940000," Thank you so much for everyone with the message."
5940000,5940960," Yo, bro, yo."
5940960,5943520," So, what was that?"
5943520,5944800," Astrofuffles."
5944800,5945920," Thank you so much for Twitchprime."
5945920,5947600," Crawl161."
5947600,5948880," Thank you so much."
5948880,5949760," RotgoMask."
5949760,5952480," Thank you so much for resubs and gifted subs."
5952480,5952800," Thank you."
5952800,5953040," Thank you."
5953040,5953360," Thank you."
5953360,5956320," Thanks everyone who's watching right now."
5956320,5957200," Really appreciate that."
5957200,5958000," Have a good one."
5958000,5962960," and I see you all on next recreational programming session with Amistazosi."
5962960,5965440," Love you."
