0,6260," Hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session with Amista Azuzin."
6260,13180," So lately I noticed that my views are down and you know what that means? That means we need to"
13180,18880," start doing another slop stream. So on today's slopping we're going to be looking at the latest"
18880,25760," Raylib release. So this Raylib release been in making for a year actually, right? So Raysan"
25760,31140," doesn't release Raylib very often because he's a busy man, right? So he's doing other things and"
31140,36240," Raylib is just his side project. Because of that I really recommend to actually support it, right? So"
36240,40520," there's some links on the website. I'm going to put the website to Raylib in the description."
40520,49800," Right, so and it's finally the time for the annual Raylib release, right? So let's take a look at it."
49800,55220," We're going to download the latest release. We're going to unbox this and look at it. So what's funny"
55220,61580," is that this time, yet again, there's probably one of my contributions in the Raylib, right? So"
61580,70540," at some point I think I submitted a fix for audio to Raylib that fixes flag support and it got"
70540,77140," merged by Raysan himself. So maybe it is in that release. So let's go ahead and maybe download this"
77140,84300," thing. So maybe I'm going to go to somewhere, maybe prop raylib. Right, so let's go ahead."
84680,89760," Maybe I'm going to just, you know, click it. So AMD 624. Let's fucking go. Let's fucking go."
89760,96140," So it is 1.7 megabytes, right? So is it bigger than the previous release? How much bigger it is"
96140,99480," than the previous release? Let's actually fucking download the previous release because I'm really"
99480,107000," curious. Right. So let's go into the releases. The previous one was, I think the previous one was"
107040,117980," actually 5.0. Right. So they skipped like four releases somehow. Right. So straight into 5.5."
120560,127520," Okay. That's very interesting. That's a very interesting use of Semver, right? So I don't"
127520,133000," really know how to interpret that, but that's how the versions are. It's actually pretty much the same"
133000,139820," size. 1.76. And it's also around that 1.7. It's actually, if anything, it's smaller, I think."
140380,148460," I think it is smaller. Okay. Let's open it up. So it's actually, you know what? So this is just"
148460,153420," the binaries, right? I'm not really interested in binaries. I should have downloaded the source code."
153900,160220," All right. So let's actually go ahead and literally download the source code. I think it's way more"
160220,164860," valuable to look at the source code. And source code is actually a little bit chunkier. All right. It's"
164860,173180," right. It's 40 megabytes. It's fine. All right. So let me go into the Raylib. And I'm going to"
173180,179660," actually move this entire thing in here. Okay. So let's go ahead and unzip it. All right. That was"
179660,184460," fast. The unzipping experience is actually quite pleasant. So it's all in a single folder, right?"
184460,190300," So it doesn't spill out of the folder if you unzip it. So, you know, unzipping experience 5 out of 5."
190300,194940," Anyways, I'm sorry. So yeah. Yeah. So"
194940,206620," why there's now two build.zeeks in here? These zigooners been running around,"
206620,212780," submitting build.zeeks everywhere. Now a single build.zeeks is not enough for them. They need a"
212780,213900," fucking second one."
213900,222780," Dude, zigooners just can't fucking stop. They have no chill. They need to multiply more and more and more"
222780,230380," files. What the fuck is this file? So is that, is that like an analog of like a log files, right? So is"
230380,235420," that what it is? It's probably an analog of log files. Jesus fucking Christ, bro. Anyways, what's happening?"
235420,242860," So yeah, we can take a look at the actual changelog, right? So as far as I know,"
242860,249740," Raysan doesn't really acknowledge everyone in the release nodes in here. He only acknowledged the people"
249740,255180," who are new contributors, right? So as you can see, it's a new contributors. So, but the full acknowledges"
255180,262620," as far as I know is in changelogs. Right. So, and there is no rexium in... Oh, okay. Well, that's,"
262620,267900," that's the previous one, isn't it? Yeah. So it's a previous release and it contains all of the releases."
267900,270060," So it was about the flag."
270060,281580," So we can take a look. Right. Ah. All right. So he put me under my actual... He leaked my name."
281580,288940," Why did he leak my... I'm joking. My name is not a secret."
289500,294380," Right. So we can take a look at the pull request that actually submitted in there. It's actually kind"
294380,301500," of a cool pull request. So let's actually go there. And boom. So this is the pull request that I submitted."
301500,307980," So there was no support for a 24-bit samples. Right. So, and what's interesting is that to have the"
307980,315020," support, you have to enable flag format. And it was actually super easy fix. Right. So you just basically"
315020,323020," do the conversion from like 24 to 16 and it will automatically work. So doxed by Ray. Yeah. So it"
323020,331500," goes submitted and yeah. So that like one of my changes, my code is now in Raylib. Yes. If you are"
331500,337020," using Raylib, you are running my code. Do you feel comfortable about that?"
337020,344860," Do you feel comfortable about me running my code on your machine? Do you trust me?"
346940,352620," Anyway. So let's actually go ahead and take a look at what we... What else did we get? Right. Anything"
352620,358940," particularly special. So there are some key changes. New tool. Raylib project create."
358940,366220," Okay. So maybe we're going to take a look at that, you know, Raylib project creator. But I mean,"
366220,373820," maybe it is needed for somebody, but I kind of like to like actually know"
375420,381420," each individual part of the project. Right. So that I have. And because of that, I usually create"
381420,386620," each individual part of the project myself. Right. So I don't really like too much magic,"
386620,391420," but I mean, maybe it is helpful for somebody, for people who only start using Raylib or maybe only"
391420,397500," start programming and stuff like that. So we also have new R-Core backends. Right. So SD..."
397500,404860," Yo, is SDL3 already out? The last time I checked chat, the SDL3 was actually not"
404860,409740," out yet. And it was like a pre-release. Did they finally release SDL3?"
409740,412940," Should I do another stream on SDL3?"
412940,419260," Two assisted Raylib. Oh, holy fuck. Two assisted Raylib speed."
419260,423740," So wait, wait, wait. Is SDL3 really out?"
425260,431820," Ready support N64 NPS4. Yeah. So I remember actually Raysan talking about it on Twitter."
431820,440300," Twitter Fitta. And yeah, so people were working on this kind of things. So this is the SDL3"
440300,446460," wiki. SDL2 is over here. How do I know if SDL3 is already out? Does anybody know? Is there any official"
446460,456860," website of SDL? Right. So library where I can just go there and it tells me bro, SDL3 is out. SDL3 is out."
456860,464860," Oh, okay. So get the SDL3 preview. Okay. So as you can see, SDL2 is the stable and SDL3 is a preview."
466140,473260," Okay. So it's not really out yet, but Raylib already supports that as a backend. And another backend is RGFW,"
473260,477980," which is kind of an interesting library. So we talked about it on Discord a little bit."
477980,485740," And it's basically a GLFW, but as a single header library. I never heard about this thing before."
485740,488940," And it looks... I actually heard about it."
494220,504380," Man, I... I check too many things. Like I work on way too many things that sometimes like I just don't"
504380,509740," have a mental dementia. It's not dementia. I just, I just work on too many things."
509740,515580," Right. So it's not like I just like committed to one single stack. I constantly switch the stacks."
515580,521500," I constantly switch the project and so on and so forth. And because of that, I have this reflex that I,"
521500,527980," if I need to do something, I just learn specific thing to do something. I do the thing and I"
527980,532940," instantly forget about all of that completely. Right. So the next time I need to work with that"
532940,537660," thing again, I have to literally relearn it because I don't just don't have a mental space to keep up with"
537660,545340," that. So probably, I probably saw this thing. Maybe I literally saw it today, but maybe we're going to"
545340,550620," take a look at that. All right. So it will be interesting to just take a look at our RGFW and"
550620,558700," see how it performs and everything. New platforms, Dreamcast, N64, PSP, PS Vita, PS4. I have neither of"
558700,565180," any of those of those. And I never even owned any of these in my entire life. Seriously."
565180,577980," Raysan, why did you have to hit me with this one? Anyway, so edit GPU, skinning. So what the"
577980,589420," fuck is skinning? Does anybody know? What the fuck? I never heard this term before, but I'm not a graphics"
589420,598540," programmer. Animations. The GPU skin. The GPU skin. So, okay. So there's a unity discussion."
601100,607020," Memory optimization. Nobody explains it. So I suppose it's like a game dev thing that everyone intrinsically"
607020,618700," understands. What is this? Skin. Okay. So let's actually Google it up. Game dev skinning. Okay."
618700,629980," What's the definition? Okay. Rigging. I kind of understand what is rigging, right? It's when"
630540,635820," you have a 3D model and you put a rig on it so you can control different parts of the body and stuff"
635820,641900," like that. Right. But what is skin in the sense of like Fortnite skins for GPU. That's what it is."
641900,649500," Right. So I get back to that. So it would be kind of nice to just have at least the definition. Since"
649500,654460," they're only about drawing, it does not care about how the node hierarchy is animated. The process is"
654460,659980," connecting them. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is interesting. So maybe they"
659980,672300," do have a definition. Skinning. Aka a skill in some RPGs. Okay. This is a way to draw a mesh connected to a node"
672300,682220," hierarchy. Artists... Oh, I see. Isn't it like an opposite of rigging? So if rig is a skeleton,"
682220,689900," the mesh around the nodes of the rig, the mesh around the nodes of the rig are skin. So basically,"
689900,698540," if you have a rig and you don't have a model, putting a model on that rig is skinning. But if you have a"
698540,705500," model, but you don't have rig, putting a rig onto that model is rigging. Did I understand it correctly?"
707500,713260," Is that what it is? Well, we can even draw that a little bit, because I'm not a game dev. I may not know"
713260,721820," certain terms and stuff like that. So I have no idea. Right. So because how I understand this scheisse"
721820,733260," mindful. Right. So you may have basically a rig, right? So which is just like some sort of a node, right? So"
733260,740620," another node and another node and another node and another node. Right. So this is the rig and"
740620,747900," everything. Right. And then you put meshes around them. And as you move this specific node, it also"
747900,754940," moves the entire mesh. Right. So skinning is probably putting a mesh on the rig. So skinning is basically"
754940,760220," a competing how mesh would look given position of bones. That's a good definition. Thank you so much."
760220,765820," Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So my brother's game dev is attaching the mesh to the node. Okay."
765820,769420," That makes sense. That makes sense now. Thank you. And I just never heard that term before."
769420,775820," So as you can see, reading change notes is educational. Right. So it is very educational."
775820,781740," Like you encounter an unfamiliar term. Just try to learn it. Just find a definition. I learned things."
781740,786780," Right. So now next time I will hear the word skinning said by a professional game developer,"
786780,794140," I will understand what the f**k they're talking about. All right. So edit Raymat C++ for it."
794140,806700," Eww. Brother. Eww. C++ in my really... This is the worst release ever."
806700,814140," Anyways. So, okay. So this is so far the key changes. Right. So we're not going to look into the details,"
814140,820860," into every single change, but we may take a look at like key ones. Right. So maybe we're going to try"
820860,826700," the tool creation, different backends. I'm not sure if we'll be able to actually check the Dreamcast N64"
826700,831420," PSP and blah, blah, blah support, but maybe there's some emulators, but I'm pretty sure setting up the"
831420,837580," simulator is going to be a nightmare. So GPU skinning and skinning in general, I'm not sure if it's going to be"
837580,843740," that interesting to look into. But we may. Raymat C++ operators, this is something that we can look into"
843740,851820," right away. Right. So just go ahead and simply find a file raymath.h. Right. So here is this"
851820,856460," mother flipper. Let's go there and let's find the word operator. Right."
858940,870060," Here it is. Thanks God. Like for a second, I got scared because I couldn't find the if depth."
870060,876460," All right. So there is an if depth. So if it's, it's only enabled if you have C++. Right. So,"
876460,882380," okay. That's actually pretty cool. That's actually pretty cool. So here are the operators. They're also"
882380,889340," inlined in everything. So yeah, that's pretty cool. I wonder how difficult it is to build this entire"
889340,897100," thing. Right. So let's just go ahead and try to make it since I have a pretty beefy, pretty beefy laptop."
897100,902860," Right. So I have how many, I think you have six. Yeah. 16 cores. Right. I have 16 cores. I can try to"
902860,911980," build very deep with 16 cores. Let's fucking go. So yeah, we're building. It has a bunch of warnings."
911980,917500," Why is it throwing warnings at me? And it's already built. Look at that. This motherfucker is already built."
917500,925420," Straight up. So you can already use 16 cores. Yeah, exactly. Why is it throwing the warnings at me,"
925420,932540," though? I do not quite understand. So argument exceeds maximum object size?"
932540,942220," Holy shit. So you were trying. So this thing was trying to allocate shit ton of memory for whatever"
942220,951660," fucking reason. What the fuck? Wait. So RC model size of T support mesh. Okay."
952780,961580," So you allocate in par mesh type. So in here. Aha. So it ends up just."
961580,971100," Yeah. So the size is too goddamn fucking huge. So that means it knows this entire thing at compile time."
971100,978220," So what is that? So you int. I honestly don't know what the fuck is that. I honestly don't know what the"
978220,985660," fuck is that. So, uh, yeah, we're also redefining GNU source, uh, and everything. So anyway, let's do a RayDeep,"
985660,994220," um, you know, um, speed run, right? So let's create main.c and just see if this entire thing even works, right?"
994220,1001100," So is the new release even working? Is it even twerking? So I probably want to do something like, uh, RayDeep.h, uh,"
1001100,1007260," Uh, so, and I'm going to just assume that, you know, the usual thing, uh, right? So just still works,"
1007260,1019900," right? So init window. Uh, so let's say, uh, hello, RayDeep find 5.5860. I think, I think the size comes first."
1019900,1028060," I already forgot how to use RayDeep. I'm sorry. Begin. Okay. I'm sorry. Uh, okay. So let's also"
1028060,1034300," return zero. And if I try to build the whole thing, if I try to build the whole thing, obviously it can't"
1034300,1041180," find anything, but I think, uh, the header is located in SRC. There we go. And the next thing we want to do,"
1041180,1048380," want to actually link with RayDeep, uh, dot a, uh, and it should be located within SRC as well."
1048380,1055420," And obviously we also need math. So I'm going to link with math as well. And it is working. It is"
1055420,1062140," twerking. And if I try to run it, we saw a window blink for a little bit. So let's actually set the target"
1062140,1070460," FPS to 60, right? And while, uh, window shoots, uh, should close while it shouldn't close,"
1070460,1078540," we're going to do begin drawing. Uh, right. So it's a clear background with, uh, maybe red and let's"
1078540,1084860," end and the drawing. Oh, why can't you just do that? Okay. So end drawing. And at the end,"
1084860,1089820," let's close the window. Right. So let's actually try to run it. Uh, and it still works. So the,"
1089820,1097900," the usual hello world of RayDeep still works in there. I'm super, super happy. So let's try to maybe"
1097900,1102940," build this entire thing with C++, right? So let's actually check the, uh, you know,"
1102940,1109500," the C++ operators, because these are the key features, right? So it encourages people to actually"
1109500,1117900," use C++, uh, instead of C, which I do not particularly appreciate, but I mean, it is what it is. So we need"
1117900,1127100," to have array math. So let's maybe actually clear background with, I don't know, something like 80,"
1127100,1133500," 80, 80, 80, F, F, right? So here we're going to be using G++, right? There we go. Uh, so yeah,"
1133500,1141260," I supposed to actually use CPP. Still working. So C++ is capable of compiling this entire thing."
1141260,1146780," So that's pretty cool. So, uh, let's actually maybe define some sort of a position, right? So we're going"
1146780,1153180," to have vector two and, uh, position is going to be maybe somewhere at zero, right? And at that exact"
1153180,1158780," position, we're going to draw, uh, maybe circle. Let's actually draw a circle, not really 3D, but I want to"
1158780,1169180," draw circle V. I think that's what it is. RayLib.h. Draw circle V. Uh, right. Draw circle V. So this is"
1169180,1174620," going to be the center. So this is a P. The radius, let's actually put 69 in there and the color is going"
1174620,1180540," to be red. So the circle should appear, according to my calculation, in the left top corner. And there we go."
1180540,1186700," Here is the circle. So one of the things we can do now, maybe we can introduce some sort of a velocity."
1186700,1191100," Oh, I forgot to put equals in here, but it doesn't matter because this is C++."
1191100,1195420," You can actually do, yeah, maybe you can even do something like this. I don't freaking know about that."
1195420,1198940," But anyway, so this is the velocity. And let's actually say that the velocity is going to be 100,"
1198940,1205900," 100. Right. The thing I want to do now, chat, chat, chat, chat, chat, chat."
1205900,1214540," I want to get frame time, right? So this is going to be DT, get frame time. So, and what that means,"
1214540,1222860," that means I can just easily do P plus equals V multiplied by DT and make this circle move."
1222860,1229820," Can your C do that? Can your C do that? I don't fucking think so."
1231820,1239980," C go. So yeah, that's the new key feature. This is what we've been waiting for the entire year."
1239980,1248940," So if you use C++ now, you can use operators, right? So, but this code, it actually makes backward"
1248940,1254220," incompatible code, right? So, but that's kind of the point of C++. C++ is not trying to be too much"
1254220,1261660," backward compatible, right? So if you try to compile it as C now, you're going to have a bad time. So,"
1261660,1267500," yeah. So there's no such thing, first of all. So let's actually go back. So, boom. As you can see,"
1267500,1274060," you just can't do this kind of shit. So the way you have to do that is vector. So let's actually"
1274060,1280460," comment it out. Right. So I don't want to lose it. So the way you have to do that in C, in pure C,"
1280460,1288780," is vector to add. Actually, first you have to scale, right? So you take V and you scale it by the"
1288780,1296700," T. So then later you can do vector to add P like this. And only then this entire thing is going to"
1296700,1306300," compile in C. Right. So this is C, this is C++. The choice is obvious. Obviously, everyone wants to"
1306300,1312700," program in C++. It's not like, on top of just fixing that small annoying problem, it comes with"
1312700,1317980," shit, ton of other slope complaints. Don't think about that. Don't think about the rest of the slope."
1317980,1324220," It fixes your little problem that you occasionally have in C. So that's why you have to use C++."
1324220,1328380," That's why you have to. And literally, Rust community also likes to use these kind of arguments."
1329020,1335340," like, yeah. So you have a little bit of a problem in C? Well, Rust fixes that. Don't look at the rest of"
1335340,1339260," the slope it introduces that you have to problem. No, no, don't look at that. Like, it fixes that"
1339260,1345900," specifically. That's why you have to rewrite everything in Rust. That's literally the level"
1345900,1352460," of stupid propaganda that is usually used in the modern tech to promote languages. It's bizarre to me."
1352460,1357420," It's just like, it's almost like designed for brainless people. Like, why? Why does it even"
1357420,1364060," f*cking work? Like, where are all actual adult engineers, right, who understand how sh*t works,"
1364060,1368220," right? Like, why this kind of propaganda actually f*cking work? Exactly! It's like,"
1368220,1372220," it's a propaganda that is designed for babies. Like, what the f*ck?"
1374060,1380300," And it f*cking works. The most bizarre thing is just like, it works. That's why software sucks, by the way."
1380300,1390140," So anyway, yeah. So this particular key feature works. So let's actually take a look at the rest of them."
1390140,1398300," Adult engineers are working on Rust. Understandable. That makes sense, actually. That actually makes sense?"
1400700,1406380," Um, lapcello binding for ray leap is tomorrow. I mean, if you're using lapcello, you can just use,"
1406380,1413900," like, you're literally using C, don't you? Um, so now find where the overload of star was defined."
1413900,1420460," It's, it's very easy. You just open ray math, right? So you just open the ray math and, like, I was"
1420460,1428940," literally looking at it. Look, look, look. Yeah. Easy. Very f*cking easy. I found it. I found it."
1429660,1436220," Uh, so, yes, yes, yes, yes. That's a lot of operators. Different kind of operators."
1436220,1441420," Uh, yep. Okay, so let's go to back to changelog. So we are done with that."
1441420,1447420," So let's take a look at this, like, fancy new ray-d project generator. So what the f*ck is it?"
1447420,1457500," Where can I f*cking find this sh*t? Uh, I don't see it. Um, so, okay, I'm gonna make an assumption. So let me, first of all,"
1457500,1464460," save this entire thing. And I'm gonna just try to find the file. Key is insensitive. NPM install Rayleigh."
1464460,1466380," Are you freaking s*t? Wait a second."
1466380,1472860," Well, I mean, it's probably bindings. If it exists on..."
1472860,1479580," Oh, it's, it's, it's just bindings. Okay. So this is fine. Anyways. Uh, so let's actually"
1480140,1487980," find generator or maybe gen, gen, genia. Right. So anything that kind of starts with genia. Any file"
1487980,1492700," that contains, maybe contains just gen. Because I'm pretty sure if there is any source code of the"
1492700,1499580," generator, it is, like, it has gen in its name somehow. And it's, maybe case is different than that."
1499580,1506140," That's why I'm looking for case insensitive. All right. So what do we have in here? Uh, texture generating..."
1506140,1518140," There's nothing. There's nothing in there. So, uh, we can RG, uh, again. Uh, that's too much."
1518540,1528460," Uh, so generate. Aha. So is there any projects? Ray leap to parse."
1528460,1536460," Um, so some people said that maybe there's something in the make file. Uh, right. So let's open..."
1536460,1546300," Where is the make file? Oh, it's in the source C. Make file create. So there's no such thing."
1547180,1552700," So, oh, it's a separate project. I see. I see. I see. So it's a separate project. Let's take a look at it."
1552700,1556540," Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, right."
1556540,1566460," Project creator. A simple and easy to use Ray leap project creator written in C."
1566460,1571500," Written in C. Okay. So let me actually put this thing in the description for anyone who's watching"
1571500,1575980," right now. So this is part of the, part of the release apparently, and it's in a separate repo."
1575980,1581740," Was it part of the bundle that we downloaded? Right. Because we downloaded this thing."
1581740,1588620," It doesn't even include it. Right. So they say that it's a part of the Ray leap,"
1588620,1593980," but it's not part of the thing that we download from GitHub. Where do we get that? Right. What's the"
1593980,1599980," official way of getting that thing? I'm really curious. Written in Ray leap, right? GUI. Oh,"
1599980,1607100," that's actually fucking cool. Okay. So if I want to download some stuff, right? So there is official bundle for"
1608460,1621100," uh, uh, it's probably comes with this, like each IO thing, $10. I'm really sorry, Ray son, but, but I encourage you to actually donate something. Uh, right. So, and there's only windows. Is it only part of the windows?"
1621100,1642860," Is it only part of the windows? Is it only part of the windows? Is it only part of the windows? I suppose it is only part of the windows. And it's actually, holy shit. Do you, do you see that?"
1642860,1653100," That's a chunky Ray leap. See, 647. That's only, that's only the installer."
1653100,1661420," All right. So I think I'm in the wrong part of Ray leap. I should not be going there."
1661420,1666460," So let's actually try to download this project generator and maybe build it ourselves. Uh, you can try it online."
1667260,1677900," Uh, oh, okay. So, so there is an online version of this thing, uh, project creator. Sure. Let's start."
1677900,1684300," I want to, okay. So I'm going to just save this thing, uh, to the description and we're going to try it a little"
1684300,1691020," bit later, but first I want to try to, uh, to build it myself. Right. So, because I want to run it natively, how difficult"
1691020,1698300," it is to, to run this thing. Uh, right. So let's actually go to probe Ray leap and I'm going to just"
1698300,1703980," simply git clone. So is there too many commits in there? Uh, only, uh, 36 commits. Okay. So we're not"
1703980,1710860," going to do a shallow clone, uh, right? Because we're not shallow people. We're doing deep, deep throat clone."
1710860,1719820," Uh, so arch, uh, Linux ISO was 60 megabytes a couple of years ago. Huh? Interesting. So it probably contains like a"
1719820,1725020," a base system and also additional packages and stuff like that. Okay. Is there any way to build it? So"
1725020,1730060," as far as I know, Ray, Ray send puts make files into SRC. Okay. So I'm going to just go and make it"
1730060,1736780," and it doesn't build, uh, because there is no Ray leap, uh, which is rather interesting. So you have to have"
1736780,1749180," Ray leap installed somewhere. So do you Ray leap include path? Okay. So Ray leap SRC path."
1750140,1751980," So is it defined?"
1751980,1768060," I mean, okay. It's under question mark anyway. So who cares? So on Linux is not going to be defined."
1770780,1774540," It's fine. It's totally fine. It just makes me chuckle a little bit when you see"
1774540,1783580," I guess where we send stories. It's project. Yeah. Leaked the project location leaked Ray sun. We know,"
1783580,1790140," we know all of your secrets, right? We know that at the folder C you have a folder of GitHub where you"
1790140,1794940," store all of your pro very good organization, very good organization of a project. I kind of do similar"
1794940,1802220," thing, right? So the way I usually do that, like I have home and I have programming. Uh, so maybe"
1802220,1806940," calling it GitHub would have been better, right? Because programming is too long, but after many,"
1806940,1812300," many years of typing this word, I kind of like don't feel like it's too long for me. So"
1815100,1825260," so under C there's also array leap folder, uh, C compiler path, uh, compiler path. Ooh. Ooh. Okay."
1825260,1830940," Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So anyway, uh, the way we can actually try to build this thing"
1831660,1838220," is by literally define this, right? So because question mark means what question mark means."
1838220,1845500," It means that if this thing is not defined, set it to that, set it to that. So I'm a little bit afraid"
1845500,1851900," that it may not even compile on Linux. Maybe it's a like windows only thing. Um, right. So it could be"
1851900,1858060," actually windows only thing. So we might actually fail doing that. So I'm going to say home, uh, right."
1858060,1869420," programming probe, um, Ray lib. Yeah. Can I just use this thing? Doesn't auto complete. Can I do that?"
1869420,1880460," Okay. So Ray leap, uh, huh? 5.5 and src. Then I do something like this. Boom. Uh, huh?"
1885660,1895980," Just work. Simplicity is the key. Look, I didn't even fucking need any documentation because the whole"
1895980,1901980," thing is just too goddamn simple. There is like nothing to even learn in here or nothing to even"
1901980,1907900," fucking explore. There's one single make file. It's self-explanatory. I just like hacked it together,"
1907900,1915420," like, and just use it. Uh, where build Ze... Ze Gunners haven't, haven't discovered this"
1915420,1920620," project. Don't tell Ze Gunners about this pro... Don't fucking tell them. Otherwise they're gonna"
1920620,1926700," come with their build.zec files. Oh, they, they don't know. They don't know. Oh."
1926700,1930540," Uh, PR@buildze."
1930540,1940540," I'm surprised that compiled. That's actually super cool. Um, so what did it create? Uh, did it... Okay."
1941660,1951100," Wait, where is the executable? Wait, so find executable. Oh, okay. Well, I mean, specifically"
1951100,1957980," file, please. Uh, is there any... Oh, okay. So it's an src. Uh, yeah, yeah. So it was kind of difficult"
1957980,1963260," to see that it is executable. Maybe I should actually hack something in Emacs so it highlights executable"
1963260,1968860," files because like I couldn't see it right away. All right. Let's actually try to run it. And it's a"
1968860,1976620," GUI application. Imagine developing native GUI applications instead of web applications in 2024."
1977740,1985820," How unhinged you have to be. Anyways, sure. Let's start. Let's... Font for ants."
1985820,1994460," Font for... Can I zoom in? Okay, like... Dude."
1994460,2003260," There should be some way to... I wonder if, if there is a scale in there. Uh, scale. Oh."
2006620,2022300," Okay. Rebuilding. Uh, running it again."
2022300,2027100," Can I... Can I... I can't even recite! Dude!"
2030780,2038540," Like, if you enable this thing, can you at least double the size of the window? Uh, platform..."
2038540,2043100," And you actually... Dude! Why are you headcoding?"
2043100,2052220," I think what this has to be... Right. So, set window size. Where do we set the window size?"
2053100,2060860," Uh... So, it's only headcoded for the web. Um..."
2060860,2064860," So, what I'm thinking, actually... Right. So, screen size double."
2064860,2070700," Uh, you just do that. But the getScreenWidth is less than double."
2070700,2075740," Since... Can you just double it?"
2076380,2082300," Oh! There's also F10. Uh-huh. So, if I press F10..."
2082300,2086380," I ha... I had to press F..."
2086380,2092620," Ah! I think I see. I think I just use it incorrectly. Chat, chat, chat."
2092620,2098300," I just use it incorrectly. I think... I think I know what the is going on, chat."
2098300,2103500," So, you're not supposed to modify the source code. You're supposed to press F10 and it will just blow"
2103500,2110620," into your face. Uh, right. At least, this is how I understand it. Right. So, let's actually"
2110620,2117340," redo this entire thing and see if it's going to fix it. Um, yeah. So, you just press F10 and it just"
2117340,2124380," blows into your face and that's how you zoom in. Uh, right. So, let's start. So, finally, I can read"
2124380,2131420," this shit and you can also read it. Uh, so, uh, the custom files. So, there is a basic sample."
2131420,2140460," Okay. So, project name - cool project. Uh, product name - cool project. So, description - my cool new project. Uh,"
2141100,2154460," So, I don't fucking even know the project name. Uh, your mom, uh, product name. Um, your mom's project."
2154460,2165740," Okay. Dude, I have a reflex. I have a reflex that every time, uh, I click on the, you know, edit field,"
2165740,2173740," I press Ctrl + A to select everything and I just can't. It doesn't select everything. Though,"
2173740,2184460," that's a bit bizarre. Uh, yeah. So, there is no selection in RAI GUI. Selection? Selection is not supported. Dude."
2187900,2195500," I'm disappointed. It also doesn't jump by word when I hold Ctrl left and right. Bro."
2195500,2203740," But, I mean, maybe the RAI GUI is not finished. Right. So, like, I actually have one of these people who"
2203740,2210140," uses, uh, you know, shortcuts, like, conventional shortcuts in editing fields and stuff like that"
2210140,2217660," a lot. Like, I hold Ctrl left and right to jump by word. I press Ctrl + A to select everything and stuff"
2217660,2222460," like that. This is actually super important for me and not supporting any of that. I, I, it doesn't even"
2222460,2227900," support home end. Like, I'm pressing home end to jump to the beginning and to the..."
2227900,2238140," Well, I mean, it's, it's, it's not really problem of the, um, of the project generator. It's not the"
2238140,2243180," problem of the project generator. It's more of a problem of, uh, the RAI GUI. Maybe in the future,"
2243180,2249580," RAI GUI is going to fix that, but as of for now, um, to be fair, it just feels that, uh, maybe it"
2249580,2255580," doesn't have higher priority. Right. So, what is higher priority? Is this thing working at all? Is the,"
2255580,2261420," like, GUI elements actually, like, you know, work roughly as intended. Right. So, and all of the,"
2261420,2265820," all of the rest of the stuff is just, like, niceties. Uh, right. So,"
2268140,2276700," so build settings, it suggests to put, uh, SRC path into here. In all honesty, we defined"
2276700,2287020," RayLib SRC path. I think what the build system should do, it should pass the RayLib SRC path"
2287660,2295420," to the source code via a macro. And it's, if that macro is defined, it should set the default path to"
2295420,2301740," that, that we did during the build. Right. I think it, this is what it should do in my, in my personal"
2301740,2307100," opinion. I think this is what it should do. We can even try to do that. Right. So we can literally try to,"
2307100,2314060," to, to find this entire thing. So, um, let me, if I try to run it again, uh, right. So let's start."
2314060,2327660," So what does it say? Um, so RayLib SRC path. Okay. So let's go there. Uh, RayLib SRC path. Okay. So here is"
2327660,2335260," the GUI label, uh, and, uh, it's just a GUI label and here's the GUI text box. So in the text box,"
2335260,2344060," this is the rectangle, right? This is the rectangle and this is the, you know, path, right? So RayLib SRC path."
2344060,2351980," What is it set to? It is literally headcoded. Okay. So what I'm thinking, so is it set anywhere else? I think"
2351980,2356780," that's the only place where it's actually set in a bunch of places, initial project config default."
2356780,2367260," Aha. Is a file extension. Uh, right. So what I'm thinking is that, uh, what we have to do"
2367260,2374220," is maybe just use this thing like that. Right."
2377980,2385020," like that. And the question is, do you even have it defined anywhere? So if I try to, uh,"
2385020,2390540," so that was weird. Just a second. If I try to build this entire thing, I think it's not going to work."
2390540,2398460," Right. Because, uh, RayLib SRC path is not actually available in there at all. So you need to have a"
2398460,2406940," hack the file system. So how do we build this entire thing? So we'll use CC, big CC, big CC."
2407580,2417100," And here is how we build this stuff. So what we can do is essentially put D in here, uh, and just say"
2417100,2424780," that RayLib SRC is equal to whatever RayLib SRC we have in there. Right. Can you see what I'm doing?"
2424780,2431900," Yeah. So just basically pass that information into the source code. Uh, so, and it will use literally"
2431900,2438780," the same thing as you did during the build. Right. So for example, if I'm building on Linux, uh, and I set"
2438780,2445580," a completely different place, it should probably set that place and that didn't work anyway. Right. So"
2445580,2453260," I know why probably because I didn't pass it as a string. Right. So that's another sort of problem that"
2453260,2460380," we haven't here. I didn't pass it as a string. So probably have to maybe say something like this. Uh,"
2460380,2470780," I wonder if it's going to actually work if I just do it like that. Uh huh. Okay. It's building and"
2472780,2482140," yeah, it's worked. Look at that. So I think that's a pretty cool change. Right. So if I don't have this"
2482140,2486700," custom environment variable, if I don't have this custom environment variable, uh, it will use the"
2486700,2493420," default with that C, you know, GitHub RayLib blah, blah, blah. So it will use it as usual. But if I rebuild"
2493420,2499980," it myself for my personal project, uh, actually it makes sense to replace it like that. It just makes sense."
2500780,2504780," Uh, and probably it makes sense to do that for all of the paths in there, because this is not the only"
2504780,2514540," path they, where they did that. Right. So, uh, so there is quite a few paths in there. Uh, so RayLib,"
2514540,2520300," RayLib SRC path, like for example, compiler path. Uh, and as far as I know, compiler path, I can also"
2520300,2526300," customize my compiler path. Uh, it would make sense to pass this information in there. Maybe RaySign actually"
2526300,2530220," has that on his mind. Uh, and maybe eventually this is exactly what he's going to do."
2530780,2535740," Uh, but it's just like my personal suggestion after working with that. So update, make file to"
2535740,2544540," boycott build.zeek. Imagine somebody actually starting some sort of a meme where they go around non-zeek"
2544540,2555100," projects where there is a build.zeek and make PRs to remove build.zeek."
2555100,2563980," Anyways, I'm joking. Doing like, doing something like that is kind of stupid, honestly, but that would be funny."
2570220,2579020," So anyways, um, we must stop it. Nah, there's no reason. Honestly, uh, doing that is as annoying as"
2579020,2585980," running around and submitting build.zeeks. Right. So it's just like, you don't really solve any actual"
2585980,2591180," problems. You just create annoyance for people. Right. So I don't, I don't think it's a, it's a"
2591180,2597340," good idea to do it like that. I'm just joking around. Uh, I'm just joking around. Uh, anyways, so"
2599340,2604540," yeah, just a second. So something, uh, let me acknowledge the subs. Uh, thank you. Thank you"
2604540,2610780," everyone who, uh, subscribed and, uh, Nicholas Danelon. Thank you so much for T1 with the message. Sure."
2610780,2619660," Remove build.zeek adding build.zeeks. No, please don't do that. Uh, please don't do that."
2619660,2627900," All right. So, uh, but we haven't tried this entire thing like at all. So let's actually see if it even works."
2627900,2633980," So let's do something like this. Uh, so let's actually do it as it is and, uh, source files."
2633980,2644140," Uh, I suppose. Okay. It's a browse. Aha. Ooh, this one is interesting. This is a classic on Linux."
2644140,2653500," This is a classic on Linux. Right. So on Windows, there is this very interesting thing, uh, that you just have,"
2654220,2661180," uh, you know, the file selection dialogue, uh, in WinAPI. So a Windows application, if you,"
2661180,2666460," it, if it wants to show a file selection dialogue, it just calls to WinAPI function and it just starts"
2666460,2672220," up the, uh, selection dialogue. You do the thing, right? It blocks your application for the time being,"
2672220,2677420," then it returns. Uh, right. And it gives you the file path that the user selected. So you can just put it"
2677420,2682860," somewhere. Unfortunately, Linux doesn't have a standardized way to create such dialogue and it"
2682860,2689820," creates a problem of creating like cross-platform GUI applications and solutions are kind of funny."
2689820,2697660," right. So you have to install separate command line utilities specifically for that. Right. So let's"
2697660,2702940," actually take a look at what we have in here. So missing software. We'll try basic console input,"
2702940,2713020," uh, tiny file belongs, uh, right. Tiny file dialogue on UNIX select or Xenity, Python 2,"
2713020,2718700," Plastic kinder, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, a dialogue and some on and so forth. So essentially,"
2718700,2723900," uh, you may try to install Xenity. I hope everyone knows this thing correctly. Right. So let's actually"
2723900,2731820," take a look at it. I, I personally never used it. Uh, Xenity, Xenity, um, program. Um,"
2731820,2740380," so can, can you do that in English please? Uh, enables you to create various types of simple dialogues."
2740380,2747020," Okay. So you can use Xenity to create simple dialogues that interact, uh, graphically with"
2747020,2753340," the user. And it's literally a command line utility. I don't think I even have it installed."
2753340,2758460," Uh, Xenity, uh, Xenity. Yeah. Okay. Let's actually try to install it. I think it's going to be interesting."
2758460,2763660," Look, I'm really curious myself. Uh, so I'm kind of curious how exactly you use it. Maybe I'm going to"
2763660,2768140," actually start using it in my applications. I vaguely remember somebody was trying to submit"
2768140,2775260," Xenity pull request, I think to mutualizer and I rejected it on a basis that it's kind of stupid"
2775260,2780780," to depend on these like third party things. But then I realized that that Linux just literally"
2780780,2785500," don't have a solution for that, except this kind of stuff. And it's just like, this is something that"
2785500,2790540," you have to do, but at the same time, you don't really have to hard depend on this kind of stuff."
2790540,2795820," You can just try it. And if it doesn't exist on the user's machine, you can just softly tell them,"
2795820,2800300," brah, I don't know how to do that. Uh, right. So I'm kind of curious myself,"
2800300,2804620," like how you use this thing. So maybe I'm going to use it in my project. We'll see. We'll see."
2804620,2814060," So XBPS, uh, query, uh, rs, uh, Xenity. Xenity. So does it exist? Okay. Oh, there's also an"
2814060,2820940," alternative to create dialogs boxing based on cute. Okay. So basically it's like a Xenity, but,"
2820940,2827980," but, but in cute. Uh, all right. But cute. So let's install this thing. Uh, I'm really,"
2836380,2851100," modern software like brah. I just, I just want to show a user. How hard is it to select the file in 2024?"
2851100,2858220," Do you really need an entire fricking browser app street? Well, I don't know. It's like, uh, like a"
2859500,2867260," app image thingy. I don't really know. Uh, anyways, let's fucking go."
2867260,2876460," I wonder how much time, I hope it's not going to be too slow because I'm over the, uh, over the VPN."
2876460,2882220," So it might be actually kind of slow to do that. Okay. That was faster than expected. I'm really"
2882220,2887740," fucking happy. Anyways. So let's take a look at Xenity. Uh, all right. You must specify dialogue type."
2887740,2896460," Okay. So do I have, uh, Team Yukos? Uh, no, I don't have Team Yukos. Xenity help. Uh, all right."
2896460,2905500," Look at that. So there's a shit ton of helps application, application calendar, uh, Xenity calendar."
2905500,2921180," That is fucking neat. Look at that. You just call this and it just returns you through the standard output."
2921180,2925340," So you can integrate, you can just do that through shell, through bash and stuff."
2926460,2933980," That is, okay. So there is also file selection. Okay. Let's give it a try. File selection."
2933980,2940700," Okay. It blew up into my face. Right. So it can just select different things. It uses like a white"
2940700,2945260," theme. I really apologize for that, but let's actually select the SQLite snapshot. And it just"
2945260,2951180," returns you the full path to SQLite snapshot. That's pretty cool. I think I should try it in my project,"
2951180,2956300," even though I rejected it at first, because like it, it is kind of a hacky solution."
2956300,2962620," honestly, it, it is kind of a hacky solution. And at first, when you, when you see it, it's just like,"
2962620,2968460," bruh, that's stupid. JDK WebKit, but yeah. So it also depends on JDK WebKit."
2968460,2978940," But then like when this, the entire infrastructure is built around the slope,"
2978940,2985180," it's not like you have choice to not use slope. It's like with JavaScript. Right. Motherfuckers just"
2985180,2990780," build the entire infrastructure around that shady language. And it's not like you can avoid it. Right."
2990780,2995260," It's built in into the infrastructure. That's why you can't avoid it. Not because it's a good language."
2995260,3000940," Not because it's a good, but it's because motherfuckers like use the fucking everything,"
3000940,3005900," even where it does not belong. So now we're kind of stuck with that. So the same thing with this,"
3005900,3010940," right. So it's just like, it's not like I have choice much. So, but as far as you know, they are"
3010940,3016220," using some sort of like, they actually choose different alternatives. Right. So,"
3016220,3023740," so there's also dialogue. It's kind of a, I think Xenity is an iteration of this kind of thing. And"
3023740,3034300," like there's a dialogue program. Yeah, that's what it is. So it's usually used by distro installers,"
3034300,3041820," Linux distro installers, you know, like the old, the old like Debian installer. Right. So it uses"
3041820,3047740," different like terminal widgets and stuff like that. As far as I know, it does that through dialogue."
3047740,3053180," Right. You can configure it to do different layouts of different widgets and stuff like that. Right. So,"
3053180,3057260," there's people say there's also X dialogue. Like I never heard about it, but I'm not surprised that"
3057260,3064220," this kind of thing exists. So, uh, let's actually see how Ray Leap project creator actually deals with"
3064220,3069340," Xenity. Does it even call, Ooh, this one is interesting. It doesn't call Xenity directly."
3069340,3076220," It could be actually using Xenity through, uh, some other dependency. Maybe, maybe there is a library"
3076220,3084700," that actually abstracts this. Fucking called it. Fucking called it. Like, dude, I like how hackable"
3084700,3090380," the entire source code is, right? It's kind of predictable, right? So it's kind of predictable."
3090380,3095020," So you can predict that there is some sort of an abstraction layer of the file dialogues and stuff"
3095020,3101420," like that. So, uh, yeah, let's actually take a look at it. Uh, it is available anywhere. So here it is."
3101420,3110140," Uh, so who wrote that? Uh, so Ray Sun himself actually wrote that. So, oh, that's actually kind of cool."
3111420,3118060," Yo, maybe I can use that as well. Can I, can I? So how do they use Xenity? No, they don't use Xenity"
3118060,3127260," directly though. Hmm. Where is the Xenity coming from then? Because I would expect it to literally just"
3127260,3139820," call it, um, directly. So let me literally do RG and just Xenity. Aha. All right. So let's do VimGrep."
3141420,3148140," Aha. So tiny file dialogue. So the actual dependency is tiny file dialogues. So the tiny file dialogues."
3148140,3157100," So white space. Oh, oh, I see. I see. So it's small library. I see how it is. I like,"
3157100,3160860," I literally see how it is. This is actually kind of cool. Tiny file dialogues. It's a,"
3160860,3164940," I never heard about this library. So this is the library that abstracts away the file"
3165820,3172940," dialogues and shit. Bro, that's so fucking cool. Have you guys heard about tiny file dialogue? I never"
3172940,3184380," heard about it. Uh, right. So here it is. I do not accept. Uh, I do not comply. Um, one CC++ file"
3184380,3193100," header provides eight functions. Beep. Just like Vim. Aha. So train notification, pop-ups, message questions,"
3193100,3199980," input password, save file, open file, select folder, color picker. That's so freaking cool. And you don't"
3199980,3205420," have to think like, so it's simply, uh, the backends is Windows, OS X, GTK, Qt, console."
3207500,3216220," I'm writing that shit down, bro, bro. So they also have, I think they migrated to, um, as, oh, they're"
3216220,3222140," still on SourceForge, but this is so fucking cool. I need to maybe put myself a reminder to look into the"
3222140,3230940," tiny file dialogues in some of the, uh, like on some of the streams. This is so cool. Uh, so this is so"
3230940,3240140," freaking cool. Uh, no, no init, no main loop, no linking, no include. Windows XP. It supports Windows"
3240140,3246140," fucking XP. Release of what? Uh, Raylip. So we're currently looking at the releases. So we can always"
3246140,3251900," do a to-do command and it will just tell you what exactly we're doing right now. Uh, right. So I usually"
3251900,3258700," put like the exact thing there. And title is for the, for the clickbait, right? I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
3258700,3265420," Don't, don't blame me. Blame the system, right? So don't blame me for like using all of these tricks"
3265420,3270940," and stuff like that. Everyone does that because that's how the system works. Uh, to be honest,"
3270940,3277580," I didn't think a file dialogue API has changed from XP to 11 at all. Yeah, true. Uh, that's true actually."
3277580,3286300," So anyway, that's actually kind of cool. So SSH console X forwarding, the dialogue can be forced"
3286300,3292620," into console mode. Curses dialogue. Why? Oh my God. It supports everything. It supports everything."
3292620,3298620," So we can just abstract everything away. That's pretty cool. Showing file selection dialogue"
3298620,3306460," is an unsolved computer science problem that requires an entire fucking framework, right? Um,"
3306460,3315820," anyways, so we, we installed Zenity. So that means this entire thing is going to work for us. Hopefully,"
3317020,3326300," so let's see, let's see, right? So it's really funny, right? So you have a file dialogue. So you need"
3326300,3336140," an abstraction layer that chooses between either an API call on one operating system or calling an entire"
3336140,3342060," separate process on another operating system. And on that, another operating system, there's actually several"
3342060,3348460," options to, to do that. It's either through a separate process of GUI application or a terminal"
3348460,3356540," application. This is like a web level of sanity. Like usually web platform has like this kind of level"
3356540,3364860," of insanity. So, uh, uh, imagine for Ray Sun having to figure that out. I mean,"
3364860,3371020," so as far as you know, tiny file dynamics is not developed by Ray Sun. He just uses that. So, but it's"
3371020,3376060," kind of cool that he knows about it. So I really recommend, like I already talked about it, but I"
3376060,3381420," really recommend to always read, uh, Ray Sun's code because he's a very experienced developer with a lot"
3381420,3389820," of, uh, you know, experience and you can just like learn a lot of things from his code. Like we just"
3389820,3395900," did. Like I never heard about tiny file dialogues. Now I know about it. Uh, right. It even supports Fortran"
3395900,3405820," and Pascal and Louvre. The last update actually recently, look at that relatively recently. So anyways,"
3405820,3411100," so let's actually try to, to, to run this entire thing. So we've been masturbating for too long chat,"
3411100,3419260," chat, stop masturbating, chat, stop masturbating, start working. Okay. Let's go. Uh, let's just do that."
3419260,3424460," And, uh, source files, where are we going to be generating this in tab? That's pretty cool. That's"
3424460,3435580," pretty cool. So let me, oh, and it, yeah, it, it blocks the, uh, it blocks the, the, the main loop of"
3435580,3443980," the applications. So very retro feel. Yeah, exactly. Very retro feel. So let's go into the home, uh,"
3443980,3449660," programming and maybe probe. And, uh, so can I just create a folder in here?"
3449660,3463740," Something, I suppose the GTK3 or maybe NOMGUI thingy relies on some capabilities of the window manager to do"
3463740,3470700," like a, uh, maybe gradients and stuff like that. And since I'm using I3, like some sort of a"
3470700,3474940," transparency, I3 probably doesn't support that. So we can end up with this."
3474940,3485340," Linux, my favorite operating system. How do I freaking create a new file? Uh, I think it's a folder."
3486300,3497340," I suppose I just created here. Or do I? Um, so add the location. Uh-huh. Because"
3497340,3505500," usually you can create a new folder in here, but I, I can't do that. It's probably not something that"
3505500,3519900," this thing supports. Let's actually, okay. So I'm gonna just do okay. Ah, ah, so you have to select source code files."
3522300,3530380," Okay. So what if I go here and the only source code file I have in here is, I'm sure it's main,"
3530380,3540060," but where is the main? Uh, where is the main that I created? Does anybody remember? Uh, there was a main."
3540060,3546220," Wait a second. Bro, bro. Just a second. Where is the main? Did I remove it? Um,"
3547980,3553740," So this one. So yeah, it's an, it's an array leap in, uh, in there."
3553740,3559980," Oh, here it is. I'm just blind. I'm sorry. I'm just a little bit blind. Okay."
3559980,3567660," And it just, okay. So it just created, but it's not full path though. It's not really full path. Uh,"
3567660,3574140," and what is it going to do? Right. So here's the source files. I can select them. Uh,"
3575020,3582780," Let's generate the project structure. Great. What the fuck did it do? Uh,"
3582780,3595900," I said, I suspect that it just shitted all of that into here. Did it not? Did it create make files and stuff?"
3597340,3607740," Great. Uh, yep. I don't know what happened. Uh, only select the first option. Now you, uh, back to custom files."
3607740,3615740," Ah, I didn't really know. So I have a suspicion that maybe it's shitted something in here, but like,"
3615740,3621980," I really don't see that. So maybe, uh, maybe we have to put some stuff in here. So let's actually put hello."
3622620,3629100," Uh, and I'm going to, uh, put everything into hello, just in case."
3629100,3636380," All right. So this is my separate project just to make sure that, uh, right. So if it creates any files,"
3636380,3643100," it doesn't mix with the Rayleap stuff. Right. So just like a separate thing. Okay. Uh, let's give it a start."
3643740,3652540," Um, oh, I was, yeah, I forgot to press basic. Ah, I see what's going on. Right. I see what's going on."
3652540,3661180," Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, and here's the output. So in the custom files, yeah, I forgot to put an out. Okay."
3661180,3666140," Okay. So because it was so big, I couldn't see what the fuck is going on. All right. So let's actually"
3666140,3672380," browse this entire thing. Uh, right. So I'm really sorry for being a little bit stupid. That's fine"
3672380,3679100," because I am. Uh, right. So here is the Rayleap. Hello. Here is the folder. Okay. So that was"
3679100,3685260," pretty convenient. Let's generate project structure. Great. Okay. And I'm going to close this entire thing."
3685820,3694380," And, uh, let's actually go somewhere here. Uh, so Rayleap. Hello. Ah, okay. I don't have to worry"
3694380,3700220," about it spilling files all over the place because it creates a separate folder and contains all of the"
3700220,3707260," shit in that folder. Thank you, Raysan. Because honestly, I have this subconscious fear every time I"
3707260,3714780," use this project generators that I will just put a wrong folder somewhere and it will just shit random"
3714780,3718780," files all over the place. And I'll have to clean them up manually because I don't really know,"
3718780,3723340," does it create a separate folder? Does it not create a separate folder? All of these project"
3723340,3727740," generators work slightly differently. And it was burned several times because of that. And it's"
3727740,3734140," just like an extremely fucking actions. Yeah. So tar X, ZX VF trauma, right? So this is because of this"
3734140,3741820," star thing, uh, there is a convention on Linux that you put all of the files into root single folders that,"
3741820,3749020," uh, so when you unpack it, right, it's, it doesn't like spill files all over the place. I think, uh,"
3749020,3753740," these kind of archives that actually spill files all over the place are called zip bonds,"
3753740,3758780," uh, or something. I kind of vaguely remember that they have name, right? So, and people on Linux are"
3758780,3765420," trying to avoid zip bonds. Uh, right. So thank you, Raysan, for not, uh, you know, shedding with the files all over the"
3765420,3772060," place on my system. I really appreciate it. Genuinely. Anyways, so what we have in here is, uh, okay. So it"
3772060,3779260," generated, it generated GitHub workflows for my ready projects. Honestly, that's kind of based"
3784300,3794700," I didn't expect that. Okay. So does it, does it automatically, okay. So it opt installs. Does it"
3794700,3803660," automatically download the right? Holy shit. This is based. So if I put that on my GitHub, it will"
3803660,3816700," automatically have a CI where it builds, not, not fucking bad, I guess. Not fucking bad. Uh, right."
3816700,3822460," So it does that for all of the platforms, WebAssembly, Windows and stuff like that. Okay. That's cool."
3822460,3829660," So it also adds conventions. Uh, right. So it enforces Raylib conventions on you. I mean,"
3829660,3835340," it really doesn't, right. So it's just, uh, this is the default. You can always delete that and just"
3835340,3840460," pretend that it never existed. All right. So, because you have your own conventions in, uh, in here."
3840460,3845740," So there's a bunch of Git ignores. It ignores in advance all of the garbage your tools may generate."
3845740,3853420," That's cool. The lightens, uh, well, I mean, it's probably generated from the company name, right? So"
3853420,3858220," because we were specifying the company name and everything, so you can customize that, but it would be"
3858220,3864140," kind of funny. You used this project generator. This code automatically belongs to Raysan"
3864140,3869660," because you use the project. You, you agreed to that. You didn't read the terms of condition."
3869660,3874540," I'm joking, obviously, right? So you can customize it, right? So you could specify"
3874540,3883980," also a chat move, right? Uh, okay. So what about read me? Uh, project fee. Okay."
3886780,3893820," Show your game to the world. Animated gifs recommended. Not bad. Not bad. That's actually"
3893820,3899020," really cool sort of like a, like a checklist for, for things to do for your projects."
3899020,3903180," I kind of like it. I kind of like it. So there's also projects."
3903900,3917180," Uh, dude, all of this shit must be a pain in the ass to test. Like, think about it. Like, he had to"
3917180,3925020," make sure that all of the workflows work. And these kind of systems, GitHub action, have a tendency to get"
3925020,3931260," outdated and become broken in a couple of years and stuff like that. So you need to test each individual,"
3931260,3937100," this thing, right? Then you have different build tools. Like, uh, you need to make sure that these"
3937100,3944060," things work and build everything correctly. That's a lot of work. Does he have some sort of like an"
3944060,3949820," automation infrastructure that does that automatically for him? Maybe he's using GitHub action as well."
3949820,3955580," But just like, it's, it's cool and everything, but it must be a pain in the ass to test all of that and"
3955580,3960220," make sure that they work on all of these use cases. But that's a lot of things, right?"
3962140,3969100," Damn. That's, that's impressive, honestly. Right. So just like maintain them up to date. Um,"
3969100,3976460," it's pretty cool. So info pdst. What is pdst? Uh, it's some Apple shit. I don't even care what it is,"
3976460,3981420," honestly, because it's Apple. Uh, so there's a makefile, right? So it's kind of similar to the,"
3981420,3987020," yeah, it's, it's literally the makefile that RaySan uses. It's, it also has RayDeep src path."
3987020,3991340," It's kind of interesting that RayDeep has this sort of convention that is kind of consistent"
3991340,3997740," throughout, uh, different RayDeep projects, right? So there's always this RayDeep src path."
3997740,4003820," Damn, consistency is the best documentation, right? So if you are consistent throughout all"
4003820,4008140," the projects, right? So people kind of know what to expect. So you kind of need to document less."
4008140,4016860," Uh, right. So there's also automatically icon nrc for your windows build. So you can have an icon."
4017500,4023420," Uh, that's Pogue. Honestly, like, I didn't really expect much from this project generator."
4023420,4030140," What, what I personally expected is just that Raysan is going to be forcing his opinion on us,"
4030140,4035260," because that's what usually this project generator does, right? I'm forcing my opinion on you. And it is"
4035260,4042700," partially true. This is an opinion of Raysan. But at the same time, a lot of these things are actually the"
4042700,4048380," things that you want to do, right? You want to have like a comprehensive CI. You want to be able to build"
4048380,4053180," on windows and have icons. This is something that you're going to do anyway. It's just like you're"
4053180,4059420," going to have a slightly different take on that, right? It is still opinion of Raysan, but it's actually"
4059420,4065100," useful things on top of that. Um, right. It's a, it's, it's just like his personal take on things that you're"
4065100,4073820," going to do anyway. Um, that's cool. Honestly, I just expected this to be like a huge meme, but it's"
4073820,4080060," actually kind of based. What I see is actually kind of based. Make it sell a tool without GUI,"
4080060,4085980," add knob H as a build. Honestly, this thing kind of inspires me to do similar things. So I have,"
4085980,4097900," I'm bleeding actually. So that's how cool it is. I started bleeding my lips. So yeah. Um, um,"
4097900,4102460," yeah. So it kind of inspires me to, to try to do my own things like that."
4102460,4112300," Raysan doesn't do memes. Yeah. He doesn't fucking joke. He really doesn't fucking joke. Um, anyways,"
4112300,4118700," so, uh, let's take a look at the, um, change lock, uh, change lock. So we, we take a look"
4118700,4124860," at the project generator. We take a look at the C++, um, operators. Uh, I think the only thing I would"
4124860,4131420," like to maybe look at today is different backends and stuff, right? Um, I think it's going to be kind"
4131420,4139660," of interesting. So I never tried RGFW or SDL3. So I would be kind of curious to try them out, but I think,"
4139660,4143580," uh, I think the time has come to make a small break. I would like to make a small break and"
4143580,4147660," refill my cup of tea. And after the break, we're going to take a look at all of these additional,"
4147660,4153580," um, you know, libraries and stuff like that. Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. All right. We are back."
4153580,4158460," So let's actually take a look at RGFW, right? So again, I've never heard about this thing. Maybe what"
4158460,4165260," I want to do, I want to take a look at it, uh, separately by itself, right? So what is RGFW thingy?"
4165260,4174700," RGFW. So, and I'm going to go on GitHub. Do I have it on a description? I think I don't have it in the"
4174700,4180300," description. So we're going to edit the description as well for anyone who's interesting, who's watching"
4180300,4189180," on YouTube. Uh, so how do you even use that? Uh, do I, can I just, so it's a single header, right?"
4189180,4194060," Well, let's wait, single header. So that means I should be able to just grab this entire thing"
4194060,4201100," and just use it. Uh, right. So it's like STB. Uh, it's like STB. So let's just go ahead and do that."
4201100,4210780," Um, so programming probe, uh, RGFW, right? Like this. And I'm just downloading it."
4212540,4220140," Okay. So it's not that big. Uh, it's only 10,000. So it's not bad. It's not bad. Look,"
4220140,4226140," look at the size, look at the size of this thing. Uh, yep. It also supports some script and look at that."
4226140,4234220," So, huh. That is a very cool thing. Okay. Let's fucking go main. Let's see. Uh, and I'm going to,"
4235260,4240380," I'm going to just include RL, uh, RL, G, F, G,"
4240380,4249180," freaking, there's something weird about the naming of these graphical libraries."
4249180,4255580," Like why are they all so fucking weird? So do, do you know what graphical library Minecraft uses?"
4260700,4268620," Uh, why all of these goddamn graphical libraries named like they smashed the keyboard?"
4268620,4275180," It's just like, what's up with the graphics programmers? It's just like,"
4275180,4282700," bro, bro, I'm going to create a new graphical library. This is my new graphical library."
4286540,4293100," Uh, anyways. So, and for anyone who's interested in, so here is the thing. So, you know, what's funny"
4293100,4303820," about L, L, W, G, J, G, L is that it's not a really library on its own. It's just a bunch of bindings for"
4303820,4311500," C libraries, right? So to use in Java, it's, it's not a thing on its own. It's just a bunch of bindings."
4311500,4318300," It's actually kind of bizarre if you, if you look at it. Uh, right. So can I download this? Where, where"
4318300,4322540," I can download this? It's just a source code. Yeah. Look at that. Look, it's to be imagery size."
4322540,4330380," Uh, it's just like, they just rub a bunch of libraries. Um, it's actually pretty big."
4330380,4334780," Maybe it's just takes too much time to download. 24 megabytes."
4335500,4341820," Just 24 megabytes. Uh, well, okay. So I hope it's not gonna, yeah, it's not gonna blow up too much."
4341820,4349820," So we're just unpacking some shit. So Vulkan. Okay. So, um, yeah, different modules, right?"
4349820,4357420," So we have different modules. You have that. There are half bus, GLFW, LLVM,"
4357980,4366700," LZ4. OpenAI. Like, it's not its own thing. There's no such thing as LWJG. It's just a bunch of bindings."
4366700,4374060," Like, all the useful code. RBM. Holy shit. All the useful code is not even written in Java."
4374060,4378620," It's written in C, in C++. Right?"
4381260,4387660," Gmalloc. It has two mallocs, by the way. Free type. Fmode is a sep..."
4387660,4398860," What? You need a separate fucking module for Fmode? Is it what I think it is? Wait a freaking second."
4403500,4410700," Fmode channel control. It's something for the sound. It's an audio... Oh, okay."
4410700,4421980," I thought it's, it's is even level of bullshit. You know, like on NPM."
4421980,4428780," Fuck, I literally thought it's like is even level of bullshit."
4431980,4439820," this one. Honestly, I wouldn't be fucking surprised. I just wouldn't be surprised if it is like that."
4439820,4453100," Dude, like, all of this stuff is the reason why nobody takes software developers seriously."
4453100,4457980," And this is literally the reason why we have a lay of waves."
4459500,4464780," Like, I just like, I'm just looking into things and it's a meme upon meme upon meme. Like..."
4464780,4470940," Keg the user. Exactly. Right? So this is literally why nobody takes this. Seriously."
4470940,4473020," Anyways."
4473020,4479660," And as far as I know, a lot of packages like literally depend on this thing. Right? Aren't they?"
4481100,4489260," So... This is... Is 10th... Oh, for fuck's sake, bruh. Bruh. Shut up. Shut up. Oh my god."
4489260,4493020," Um, I can't even open it because I'm stupid."
4496620,4505660," Um... Engineer man. What the fuck. Uh... Repository is 10,000."
4505660,4510860," Smokedest. Okay, so index.js."
4512300,4525660," Oh. Do something. I see. Do something. I see."
4525660,4527660," *Sigh*"
4527660,4532140," *Sigh*"
4532140,4533660," *Sigh*"
4533660,4536140," *Sigh*"
4536140,4538220," *Sigh*"
4538220,4542780," Anyway, so, um, let's actually continue. What I was doing?"
4542780,4551740," I forgot what I was doing. Uh, so, let's go into the prop, uh, or, of the RG of this, this one."
4551740,4560300," All right, so here's the main.c. And let's first start with simply building this entire thing. Right?"
4560300,4566940," So I'm going to do CC main, main.c. Boom. And, uh, it fails with a bunch of warnings."
4566940,4568940," So inline function declare, but never defined."
4568940,4574700," Cool. That is very useful. Thank you so much for telling me all of that."
4574700,4579900," Um, so I wonder... I didn't even enable all the warnings since it's already shitting with warnings."
4579900,4583020," That is fascinating, isn't it?"
4583020,4589740," Anyways, uh, so how do I even use that? How do I call it? Maybe it is self-explanatory. Actually,"
4589740,4595980," let's actually test how self-explanatory this header is. Right. So there's a license in here."
4595980,4602060," Uh, yeah. So obviously you probably want to have implementation. We're going to edit, uh, at some"
4602060,4608300," point, but maybe later. Uh, right. So I'm going to comment it out because I wanted to fail with linking errors."
4608300,4614380," Um, right. So print errors. Make it so RG of W prints errors when they found."
4618220,4625260," Okay. Uh, so just draw directly to window pixel buffer that is drawn to the screen."
4625260,4627500," The buffer is in RGB format."
4627500,4629500," Ooh."
4634620,4640620," That is so fucking cool. So different options and stuff like that. So you can redefine that."
4640620,4645820," What a beast fucking library. What the fuck?"
4645820,4652620," Fuck JLFW. Well, I mean, if this thing works, we don't even know if it works. Uh, yeah, it's a STB style."
4653180,4660220," Imagine STB style JLFW. They even, uh, you know, talk about JLFW. Seven parts of Win API in Excel are very poorly documented."
4660220,4666140," JLFW source code was referenced and used throughout the project. The used code is marked in some way."
4666140,4671660," This mainly includes code for drag and drops code for setting icons to bitmap and code managing blah, blah, blah."
4671660,4678540," So they use a little bit of JLFW. So they credit it. So that makes sense. I suppose that makes sense."
4678540,4687580," Okay. There is no really example on how you initialize and create it. I suppose you have to look into that, uh, for, for that in the, um, in the read me."
4687580,4691580," Right. So am I looking at the right thing? I don't think I'm looking at the right thing."
4691580,4698460," So is there a GitHub? Um, okay. So I think I lost, oh, here it is. I was looking for my link to,"
4698460,4706540," to the GitHub, uh, official platforms, examples. All right. So it's okay. So this is how we do that."
4706540,4716540," So we do create window. Okay. Uh, so that's pretty cool. So create window name, rectangle, and different"
4716540,4723340," arguments. I suppose these are different flags and you have to specify a rectangle. This is kind of cool."
4723340,4729340," So through a rectangle, you can specify also the position where the window is going to be located."
4729340,4739500," One weird part is that they define their own i32, i64 types, depths, without a prefix, uh, define i32, wait,"
4741660,4749740," i32. Huh? It's, it's actually a common thing, honestly. Like I've seen a lot of C in C++ developers"
4749740,4754940," do that from time to time because they are annoyed to type this thing. And I like like a very short and"
4754940,4764060," sweet names for, for integers. It's, it's not very uncommon. It is pretty common. Um, okay. So"
4765420,4774620," create window. Let's copy paste this entire thing. And it should give us a window. Uh, so I suppose this"
4774620,4780060," is the window. Uh, I should probably save it somewhere. So this is going to be the window."
4780060,4788220," So name of the window, uh, hello, the rectangle. Um, I'm going to say, let's put it in the left top corner"
4788220,4795500," and let's give it the size of 800 by 600. Uh, that was weird. Okay. So, and in here, extra arguments,"
4795500,4801820," I suppose, is going to be zero. And that should be enough. Can I just build this entire thing? So it"
4801820,4808700," fails. It fails with return because if I got semicolon, that's fine. It fails with linkage error. So if I"
4808700,4819180," enable GLOW, what is going to fail with it fails with GLX and shit and X and everything that is kind of cool."
4819180,4831340," So do we do LX, uh, Xlib? I don't remember how do you link with, you know, lib X and whatnot. Does anybody"
4831340,4841500," remember? Um, X11, right? Thank you. Thank you so much. X11. Cool. So now it wants GLX. Um, I don't"
4841500,4850140," remember. Is it just, you know, GLX, GLX. Uh, so let's go and maybe, maybe I will have to install something"
4850140,4861260," actually. Uh, I don't quite remember. X query, uh, GLX or SME. Okay. Um, so is it like a big GLX?"
4862060,4870140," It's a libGL. You think it has to be libGL. Maybe it has to be libGL. Um, so I do have..."
4870140,4878460," All right. So this probably comes from Mesa, right? And I do have Mesa installed. Uh huh. So let's give it a try."
4878460,4882620," So JL."
4882620,4890380," Okay. So I see a little bit of a math. I see a little bit of a math. So we can, uh, do that."
4890380,4897420," And there's also X, R, R, blah, blah, blah. All right. So what's about this function?"
4897420,4907020," Um, how do I, so X gets screen info. X render. Okay. So maybe I have to, is it X render? Um,"
4907980,4917980," Or is it just render? Hmm. Um, so how do you call the render thingy?"
4917980,4927980," Queering, uh, render. Uh huh. Okay. So it's capitalized. So I suppose for me to use,"
4927980,4933580," I have to capitalize X, figure it out. Look at that. Look at it. I actually figured it out."
4933580,4939500," That's pretty funny. Uh, using a little bit of a package manager magic and stuff like that,"
4939500,4944780," we managed to figure it out. So let's take a look at the final executable. Uh, right. So it depends on"
4944780,4949340," the, on the things that we told it to depend, right? So a little bit transitive dependencies and stuff like"
4949340,4957900," that. Uh, all right. So, and let's go ahead and maybe try to run it. Uh, and I saw a blink. Did you"
4957900,4966700," see a blink chat? I saw a little bit of a blink, I think. Uh, yeah. So it was actually too fast. Uh,"
4966700,4970700," right. So the, the, the blinking ray leap is a little bit slower, probably because it just"
4970700,4977660," initializes too many things. Um, the bitrate did something. Okay. Understandable. All right. So that's"
4977660,4982140," pretty cool. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. So what's going to be the next thing. So we're not"
4982140,4989260," going to be setting icons or anything. Uh, we can actually jump straight into the loop from what I can"
4989260,5000460," see. So not quit while not quit. Uh, we just check certain events. Ha. So there's a special function"
5000460,5006540," window check event. All right. Let's take a look at it. So window check event. And it's, it just pulls"
5006540,5012940," event out of the queue. I suppose that's basically the idea, but it gives you a pointer. I wonder where it"
5012940,5020300," stores this thing. Does it allocate it on a heap or maybe it just, uh, let me see. So I'm going to just"
5020300,5027580," search for this thing. Okay. So it's not defined like this. Is it defined? What am I looking at?"
5027580,5039740," So here's the implementations that are indented. Why the are they indented? Are they indented intentionally?"
5042940,5047260," That is bizarre. Why the fuck are they indented?"
5047260,5058300," I mean, I don't mind. Uh, it's just weird. So it's just like, let's put it this way. Unusual,"
5058300,5064780," right? So they're indebted according to, uh, to the macros they're wrapped in or something. Okay."
5064780,5071500," So, and there's actually two of these things. Um, I suppose maybe one for, for Linux, another one for"
5071500,5079900," Windows. So what I see in here. Okay. So this is X 11 and stuff like that. And we return either new,"
5079900,5085500," we return event. So we do Linux update the joystick. So it comes from somewhere here."
5085500,5092940," Uh, right. So, and when it returns something, when it returns something, it returns a pointer."
5092940,5098540," Aha. Okay. So this is basically what's going on. It doesn't really allocate anything. It's allocated"
5098540,5102060," within the windows. And what it does, it just returns a pointer to an"
5102060,5108060," field within the window that we pass anyway. So if there's any allocations, they have,"
5108060,5113580," they happen at the moment of creating the window. Okay. So I just, I just saw that function returns a"
5113580,5119500," pointer and that's a, like a red flag for me. So like, where does it get the memory from?"
5119500,5123660," Right. So does it allocate it? Yeah. It allocates it in here. So, but it's like,"
5123660,5126300," you don't have to delegate anything. So that's basically what's going on."
5126300,5133420," Uh, love that one that isn't documented. Well, I mean, this is a single header library and it's"
5133420,5138700," very small. So you can say that it's kind of self-documented because nothing stops you from just"
5138700,5143260," looking at the implementation and seeing, and that's literally what we did. So maybe that's fine"
5143260,5150140," in, in this specific case, at least. Uh, so, so here's the event and let's do the window."
5150140,5159180," So, and sometimes it may return actually, uh, yeah. Ooh, this is actually kind of cool. Look at that."
5160140,5167980," They just check that it returns not new and then they directly access event,"
5167980,5174780," which indicates that whatever this function returns is always either new or the pointer to this thing"
5174780,5181260," anyway. Okay. So that's, that's pretty cool. So that's a really cool way to just, uh, you know,"
5181260,5188060," check if there's any events in a queue. Um, right. So, and then you can check whether it's a quit or"
5188060,5194860," it's a escape pressed. Okay. So in our case, we probably want to actually do escape, right? If, uh,"
5194860,5202540," I mean quit, uh, and if it's a quit, we're going to do quit true, right? And I suppose that's it."
5202540,5205340," So one of the things we can do, yeah, we can just clean the,"
5206220,5211420," the color buffer, right? So we just clean the color buffer and we swap the buffers,"
5211420,5220060," right? So we can see this entire thing. So the reason, um, white color, uh, let's actually use red color."
5220060,5229660," And after that, they just close the window. This is pretty straightforward actually. Okay. Let's go"
5229660,5235260," ahead and try to do this entire thing. So it doesn't know anything about the Boolean. Okay. Let's actually"
5235260,5244860," include std-bool.h. Uh-huh. So this is the window, uh, window like this. And this is the window."
5244860,5249020," And we probably have to do that in here, copy, paste, and code, by the way."
5249020,5257020," All right. So that's pretty cool."
5262380,5269340," I'll restart it. I'm going to start it again. It's, it deserves a start, right? So that's, that's nice."
5269340,5275420," So it doesn't even depend on that much. So in this cross platform, right? So it also works on windows."
5275420,5280300," Uh, right. As they say, windows.a. Yeah, there we go."
5280300,5287100," So I want to actually maybe create a separate, like, um, make file or some stuff like that."
5287100,5294940," So I don't have to type this shit over and over again. Uh, main.c. Right. So I can just do make b and it works."
5294940,5300780," I wonder if I can do something cool with this kind of stuff."
5301820,5312780," Um, right. So this is sus. It's supposed to be actually kind of dark."
5312780,5325260," JL clear color. Um, red. Ah, wait a freaking, wait a freaking second."
5326700,5334460," Does the... Wait, I didn't even fucking notice."
5334460,5340380," Do you notice anything weird about this call of JL clear color?"
5340380,5354700," I didn't... It's so subtle. I myself didn't even fucking notice that."
5354700,5363260," So for this who doesn't know, uh, the values of JL clear color is from zero to one and it's a float."
5363260,5366620," So what you're supposed to do in here is actually one."
5366620,5373900," Well, I mean, I can't make too much fun about it because I myself also didn't notice that."
5373900,5377580," So it was just like, they were copy pasting things around. That's fine."
5377580,5378540," But that's just funny."
5378540,5385580," This is actually funny. I like that. Uh, so what I want you to do."
5385580,5390140," So in, in my case, I want to specifically color, uh, this, right?"
5390140,5397660," So, and to achieve that exact color, I suppose one thing I can do is just like divide it by, uh, maybe 255."
5397660,5404620," Right. So that's way, uh, that way I kind of can have that, uh, right in here."
5404620,5406220," So that's going to be cool."
5406220,5408860," So this is the color of the background of my editor, right?"
5408860,5413980," So, uh, and if I try to run this entire thing, yeah, it's, it's exactly that."
5413980,5415980," Right. So it's exactly that color. Cool."
5416620,5419260," Uh, do I have things like gl begin?"
5419260,5420380," All right."
5420380,5428540," And, uh, is it, does it, is it going to work? I wonder."
5428540,5431740," So I think you just do gl end, but I don't remember."
5431740,5438300," Um, so gl end, oh, gl end doesn't accept anything."
5438300,5440860," Okay. It compiles at least."
5441900,5445980," Um, so gl color, I think three F, right?"
5445980,5447980," So we're going to have a bunch of colors here."
5447980,5455820," So, uh, it's going to be that, then that, then that."
5455820,5456620," Is it working?"
5456620,5458780," Uh, okay."
5458780,5468460," Gl vertex two F, uh, so minus half, uh, yeah, minus half as well."
5468460,5472300," So it's the left leg, then it's going to be that leg."
5472300,5475180," Uh, maybe, maybe we're going to do in the middle."
5475180,5477180," So that means in terms of X, it's going to be that."
5477180,5480540," Uh, and in terms of Y, it's going to be that."
5480540,5483180," And this one is going to be just to the right."
5483180,5483980," And, uh,"
5483980,5492700," OpenGL 1.0 will never fucking die."
5493580,5496620," 1.0 OpenGL will never fucking die."
5496620,5499020," It's the best OpenGL API."
5499020,5499420," Hate me."
5499420,5501100," Hate me."
5501100,5505660," Fuck all of your retained API."
5505660,5509420," This API is fucking best one."
5509420,5512620," Yeah."
5512620,5513740," And it will never die."
5513740,5516460," People like me will never let it die."
5518140,5522140," And people like Rayson, by the way, do you guys know what Rayson did?"
5522140,5525500," Uh, he created a very cool thing called RLGL."
5525500,5526380," Right."
5526380,5533500," And RLGL is basically a layer on top of OpenGL that makes it look like OpenGL 1.0."
5533500,5534540," Right."
5534540,5540140," So even if you don't have an opportunity to use OpenGL 1.0, you can have an interface that"
5540140,5546220," looks like OpenGL 1.0, but internally it just like, you know, implements, uh, immediate mode."
5546220,5546380," Right."
5546380,5547500," So we can even take a look at that."
5547500,5548540," So it's actually super cool."
5548540,5557340," So prob array lib, uh, so RL GL."
5557340,5563180," And what's funny is that the Ray, like Raylib itself is not really implemented on top of OpenGL."
5563180,5565660," It's implemented on top of RLGL."
5565660,5567020," Right."
5567020,5573660," So, uh, Rayson is trying to use the best OpenGL API instead of that weird shit that"
5573660,5575340," people have come up with over the years."
5575340,5576460," Uh, so yeah."
5576460,5579980," So it's a multi OpenGL abstraction layer with the immediate mode style API."
5579980,5583180," So yeah."
5583180,5590380," Even if you deprecate the best API in the world, it will still live on in the form of RLGL."
5590380,5591500," You can't kill it."
5592060,5596780," Even if you officially deprecate it, even if you fucking remove it from all of the OpenGL"
5596780,5600220," implementations, it will live on in the form of RLGL."
5600220,5602860," And there will be nothing you'll be able to do that to stop it."
5602860,5606060," Because immediate mode API for OpenGL is the best."
5606060,5607580," It is the best."
5607580,5608460," It's the most intuitive."
5608460,5609980," This is exactly what you want to do."
5609980,5614300," And if you use any graphics API, you, you end up re-implementing it fucking anyway."
5614300,5619900," Uh, so just saying, just saying, just saying the same."
5619900,5624620," So it has things like RL begin, for instance, right?"
5624620,5625100," So yeah."
5625100,5629660," It's basically like OpenGL, but with RL prefix instead of GL."
5629660,5631740," Uh, right."
5631740,5634940," So it's kind of, it's a little OpenGL, but with a different prefix."
5636540,5637180," It's so funny."
5637180,5637580," I love it."
5637580,5638620," I freaking love it."
5638620,5641180," We can even take a look at the RLGL begin implementation."
5641180,5642540," So here it is."
5642540,5645020," Yeah."
5645020,5649660," So it, it just calls to OpenGL 1.0 or 1.1."
5650220,5653900," But it's only when OpenGL is 1, right?"
5653900,5655980," So, but there's other implementations."
5655980,5660220," So for example, if you use different ones, it has a batch buffer."
5660220,5666940," So it basically, uh, queues all of this like information and like into the buffer and then"
5666940,5667740," sends it to OpenGL."
5667740,5674300," So basically what he does for higher versions of OpenGL, it, he literally implements the immediate"
5674300,5675980," mode like, like this, right?"
5675980,5677020," So here's the implementation."
5677020,5679020," It has a very long lines, bro."
5679020,5688460," 80 characters column, please."
5688460,5690300," Fucking please."
5690300,5695180," How about four headed in six characters column?"
5695180,5697180," How about that?"
5697180,5701580," Just buy a wider screen."
5701580,5704220," Just buy a wider screen."
5704220,5708140," Anyway, so basically RLG, how do you even call it?"
5708140,5710380," I can't remember, RGFW."
5710380,5714700," So now, um, array leap can work on top of this thing."
5714700,5720060," So before it was working on top of JLFW, it still works on top of JLFW, but now you can use"
5720060,5721580," this thing, right?"
5721580,5724540," So, and I wonder how you can force, uh, using this thing."
5724540,5730380," It's probably, uh, it's probably through the, the macros, not really macros, but environment variables."
5730380,5733180," So there is a thing called platforms, right?"
5733180,5738060," And as you can see, uh, we have different desktop platform implementations, right?"
5738060,5742860," JLFW, RGFW, and SDL for SDL3, I suppose."
5742860,5746060," But maybe this one is used for both SDL2 and, yeah."
5746060,5746300," Okay."
5746300,5749020," Dependencies SDL2 or SDL3."
5749660,5754780," So the architecture of, uh, array leap is rather simple and straightforward, right?"
5754780,5762460," So it just tries to abstract away different sort of graphical libraries for initializing OpenGL,"
5762460,5763260," right?"
5763260,5779660," So basically the job that DOS libraries are supposed to do in the first place."
5779660,5801740," C-Make options, uh, as far as now, C-Make is not really actively maintained by Ray Sun himself."
5801740,5802540," I don't really know."
5802540,5807340," So he primarily uses make files."
5807340,5813340," So make file build is what Ray Sun himself updates, as far as now."
5813340,5819420," There's no problem in computer science that can't be solved with one more layer of abstraction,"
5819420,5820140," except one."
5820140,5822700," Too many layers of abstractions."
5822700,5826380," So there's one problem that you can't solve with adding another layer of abstraction."
5827020,5832860," And it is actual problem that is these days becoming an actual problem that affects the"
5832860,5834060," quality of software."
5834060,5837820," And the quality of software, by the way, affects the quality of your life."
5837820,5840780," Because we're using software everywhere, right?"
5840780,5844300," In the past, the quality of software didn't really affect our life that much."
5844300,5844540," Right?"
5844540,5847900," But since software is everywhere and it literally controls our lives,"
5847900,5850620," the quality of software actually kind of matters."
5850620,5855740," Just keep adding them until it all flows to zero."
5857020,5861180," Yeah, by the way, this is actually a good point."
5861180,5863820," You can actually build a RayLib with just this."
5863820,5866860," You can just take all of the C files in the source folder,"
5866860,5869740," just do GCC and you have a RayLib."
5869740,5876220," But depending on the platform, you will have to supply additional macros."
5876220,5876460," Right?"
5876460,5880540," So you have to say platform desktop that, platform desktop this,"
5880540,5882380," maybe additional flags and stuff like that."
5882380,5885340," So as far as the make file just automates that specifically."
5885900,5886140," Right."
5886140,5892060," So, and through the make file, we have to maybe specify this stuff."
5892060,5894780," The file supports building for the following platforms."
5894780,5898220," RayLib desktop defaults to RayLib desk.glfw."
5898220,5899660," Okay."
5899660,5902700," So, I suppose"
5902700,5907500," I can take a look at the external."
5907500,5909740," Yeah."
5909740,5911260," So here is the dependencies."
5911260,5913580," Here is the RGFW, right?"
5913580,5914380," Single header one."
5914380,5918860," And I wonder if I just enable this thing."
5918860,5923580," So it just checks that it's defined."
5923580,5924780," Right."
5924780,5925660," That's what it does."
5925660,5927500," It simply checks that it's defined."
5927500,5929580," I'm going to, I'm going to make a wild assumption."
5929580,5933260," The only thing you have to do is just something like this."
5935420,5935980," All right."
5935980,5935980," All right."
5935980,5939740," It still uses glfw."
5939740,5942780," So that's probably not how we do that."
5942780,5943900," Okay."
5943900,5945820," So let me take this."
5945820,5948540," Target platform."
5948540,5952860," Do you have to set target platform platform to that?"
5952860,5954620," No."
5955740,5956380," All right."
5956380,5962860," So one of the things we can do maybe is put it in here."
5962860,5965740," No."
5965740,5967660," Minus D."
5967660,5969260," No."
5969260,5970700," This is not how we do that."
5970700,5973740," So let's actually see."
5973740,5977180," Target platform."
5977180,5979500," Well, yeah."
5979500,5981340," So it looks for target platform."
5981900,5986700," And if target platform, you should set target platform to one of these things."
5986700,5987500," That's for sure."
5987500,5993420," But yeah, I don't really see any stuff."
5993420,5995340," Okay."
5995340,5995580," I see."
5995580,5996460," That's probably what it is."
5996460,6002220," Make target platform."
6002220,6005900," So you set it on the level of make instead of the level of bash."
6005900,6007420," That's what's going on in here."
6007420,6008060," And that works."
6008060,6008300," Okay."
6008300,6008700," Thank you."
6008700,6009020," Thank you."
6009020,6011420," So that actually works."
6011420,6013260," So, and it should be able to build it."
6013260,6016380," So from the outside, it shouldn't change that much."
6016380,6016780," Right."
6016780,6021980," So it's just like depending on what platform we provide in here, you just do different things."
6021980,6024300," And I don't have SDL, by the way."
6024300,6024860," Speaking of."
6024860,6027180," Do I really not have SDL?"
6027180,6028140," Seriously?"
6028140,6029020," God damn, bro."
6029020,6030460," BPS."
6030460,6032780," RS."
6032780,6033500," Leap SDL."
6033500,6035660," What the fuck?"
6035660,6038220," Okay."
6038220,6043740," So I have SDL two."
6043740,6049340," Ah, maybe it wants SDL three, because I do have SDL two devil."
6049340,6051180," Right."
6051180,6053180," I don't know what's up with that."
6053180,6054380," I don't know what's up with that."
6054380,6057660," Maybe it wants some more elaborate."
6057660,6058300," Should I say?"
6058300,6060220," So it's trying to use SDL two."
6061660,6064460," I think I remember vaguely having this kind of problem."
6064460,6064780," Right."
6064780,6065340," It wants."
6065340,6067500," What does it want?"
6067500,6070060," I'm really curious."
6070060,6071580," So make file."
6071580,6074380," SDL."
6074380,6075820," So SDL backends."
6075820,6079820," So it's a platform SDL."
6079820,6081900," Okay."
6081900,6083260," So just SDL."
6083260,6086140," Lib SDL two."
6086140,6089260," I remember that."
6089260,6089500," Yeah."
6089500,6090620," Yeah."
6090620,6091020," Yeah."
6091020,6093020," I just fucking remember that."
6093020,6094460," So it wants."
6094460,6097900," You to have."
6097900,6100860," External SDL two."
6100860,6101100," Yeah."
6101100,6103900," Uh, it's not included in Revit."
6103900,6105020," It must be configured."
6105020,6105260," Yeah."
6105260,6105420," Yeah."
6105420,6111180," We had literally the same problem in the previous radio, uh, review stream."
6111180,6111420," Right."
6111420,6112540," So release review stream."
6112540,6117980," So you have to download like a distribution of SDL two and you have to put it yourself in there."
6118460,6121180," Uh, in terms of SDL three, uh, right."
6121180,6123180," So is there, I didn't see SDL three, honestly."
6123180,6124700," So it's not even mentioned in there."
6124700,6130460," Uh, there's no mentioning of SDL three, but maybe you have to, maybe it's an experimental platform of some sort."
6130460,6133580," Uh, why does it want?"
6133580,6135900," It doesn't really want anything."
6135900,6136940," Right."
6136940,6138380," So it doesn't really want anything."
6138380,6139660," It gives you options."
6139660,6140060," Right."
6140060,6147100," So, uh, essentially like if you don't like LGLW or this thing, but you have SDL,"
6147100,6151900," you can instruct it to build, to use SDL for initializing windows and OpenGL."
6151900,6152140," Right."
6152140,6155180," So it can work on top of any of this library."
6155180,6157660," Uh, so that, that's basically what it is."
6157660,6159580," It doesn't really want SDL by itself."
6159580,6162780," Uh, it just gives you an option to use SDL if you want to."
6162780,6168380," Um, because the only thing it does is just initializes the window, initializes OpenGL context,"
6168380,6171340," and then it just works with OpenGL from now on."
6171340,6173420," It doesn't really need any of these libraries,"
6173420,6176380," except maybe for the situations when it tries to handle the input."
6176380,6176540," Right."
6176540,6179660," So, because, uh, you handle input in them differently."
6179660,6181180," They all have different APIs for that."
6181180,6185660," Um, there is a, you can work with DRN directly."
6185660,6189340," Ah, it's for Raspberry Pi."
6189340,6190460," Holy."
6190460,6191500," This is base."
6191500,6192300," What the fuck?"
6196860,6201100," Dude, can your web do that?"
6201100,6203180," Can your web do that?"
6203180,6205660," This shit is more cross-platform than browser."
6205660,6209180," Can you run your browser on the Dreamcast?"
6209180,6210700," I don't fucking think so."
6210700,6212540," I don't fucking think so."
6212540,6216300," If I write the radio publication, it's more cross-platform than JavaScript."
6216300,6218620," Than fucking JavaScript."
6225020,6229740," Anyway, so, okay, I think we basically looked at all of the key sort of changes,"
6229740,6231820," except maybe the skinning and stuff like that."
6231820,6233260," But it's just like a 3D thing."
6233260,6235580," And I'm not a 3D graphics programmer."
6235580,6237580," So, what can I say?"
6237580,6239020," Base released."
6239020,6241340," Five out of five."
6241340,6242060," And look at that."
6242060,6244300," It is in exactly 5.5."
6244300,6244620," Ready?"
6244620,6245580," 5.5."
