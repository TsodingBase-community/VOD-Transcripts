960,6560," Hello and welcome to another Zozin session. How about that?"
6560,10680," But you didn't expect that shit to happen yet again."
10680,16480," So today we're going to continue working on our weird video generator thingy."
16480,23740," I feel like my projects become more and more obscure as I go further."
23740,30040," As my mental state deteriorates, my projects become more and more obscure."
30040,32600," And that's the project we're working on today."
32600,39200," So, well, I'm going to leave the link to the playlist of the project in here."
39200,44540," So the playlist for 2mpeg4u."
44540,49460," And I didn't create the playlist yet, so I'm going to create it after the stream."
49460,57960," So the idea of this project, right, was at least to explore a very simple video format"
57960,63460," that you can just generate yourself manually without using any libraries."
63460,68000," And I want you to explore that format because it has a huge potential for debugging purposes, right?"
68000,73400," So if you want to debug some sort of like a motion or some sort of like a simulate some sort of a system,"
73400,76720," you don't need to use any OpenGL stuff."
76720,80400," You can just generate the video and play it with the video player that supports that format."
80400,87820," As we were just playing with the format, we implemented, you know, a simple simulation that looks kind of cool, right?"
87820,91480," And we started to do all sorts of cool things with it."
91480,97140," And that went outside of the original scope of the project, right?"
97140,98680," So that's basically what we're doing."
98680,101000," We're just working on these weird simulations."
101220,112320," So right now simulation is a little bit broken, but I think on Twitter, I still have a video that captures the state,"
112320,114840," like what kind of stuff it can generate, right?"
114840,119500," So, yeah, so this video, you can find it in here, right?"
119500,124460," So, and basically our video generator can generate these kind of videos, right?"
124460,132780," So it generates like a very simple simulation that, you know, makes the rectangles that bounce off of the walls."
132780,139440," And when they bounce, they actually split in two and start moving in opposite directions and become smaller and smaller until they all disappear."
139840,142780," So that creates a pretty cool pattern, as you can see."
142780,146080," And we also color rectangles in like rainbowish colors."
146080,149100," So it like creates a very, like a pleasing picture."
149100,154440," So you can find this thing in the chat or in the description, right?"
154440,159260," So the cool video from Twitter, right?"
159260,160100," Cool."
160100,160700," Yikes."
160700,161180," Cool."
161180,162780," Right."
162780,163500," So it's called cool."
165840,172260," So, and we broke it recently because I was trying to introduce sound to the video generator, right?"
172260,175080," So right now we're generating only the, you know, the visual part."
175080,180680," But we then yesterday tried to introduce some sort of a sound."
180680,184500," And to introduce the sound, I simplified the animation a little bit."
184500,186800," So to impact for you."
186800,192380," And let me actually clean everything up and regenerate the video one more time, right?"
192560,195340," So basically I stripped off all of the rectangles."
195340,196940," I only left one rectangle."
196940,202340," And when the rectangle hits the wall, I make it play a sine wave beep, right?"
202340,208540," And as it bounces more and more, the, that beep, like the frequency of that beep increases."
208540,210840," And that creates a pretty interesting video, I suppose."
210840,212020," Right."
212020,214880," So let's actually regenerate the video and let's see how it looks like."
214880,218200," So it will take some time because this is a raw video format."
218340,223740," So it generates huge files and it takes some time, but it doesn't require any special libraries"
223740,224900," or any special encoding."
224900,227700," And that's kind of the, the point of this format, right?"
227700,229120," That's kind of the point of it."
229120,234660," It doesn't have to be good for storing or transporting things."
234660,237460," It's specifically for debugging things."
237460,241160," That's what I want to use it for personally."
242300,248580," Because we don't have that many, like, sort of like debugging video formats or, yeah."
248580,255000," So that's basically what it does."
255000,257540," And this is what we did on the, on the previous stream."
257540,261160," Don't worry."
261160,261940," It's not going to blow up."
264200,264800," So, yeah."
264800,273840," And today I want you to improve our audio system to actually support hundreds of the rectangles,"
273840,274180," right?"
274180,277140," So, because right now it can only play one beep at a time."
277140,282080," And you can even hear sometimes when it needs to play consequent beeps, they actually clip"
282080,288540," a little bit because, because of how we manage the, the sound waves and stuff like that."
288540,292180," So it's kind of, it's kind of difficult to explain, but maybe I can try to explain what"
292180,293300," exactly is the problem here."
293420,299920," So there, there is a, like a really weird audio bug that, um, maybe you can hear, maybe"
299920,300300," not."
300300,304780," It just depends on how much the streaming obscures everything."
304780,305780," Uh, just a second."
305780,308840," So I'm going to try to listen to it myself."
308840,313400," So sometimes it actually sort of cracks or clips."
313400,315120," It doesn't really clip, but cracks."
315120,317000," Um."
322640,329140," It usually happens when there's two quick consequent beeps, especially when it bounces off of two"
329140,330580," sides, like very, very quickly."
330580,334140," Like here, uh, you can hear that's like small click in there."
334140,335740," Yeah."
335740,336240," Right here."
336240,340660," Yeah."
340660,341460," Another one."
345920,354480," So, and this happens because, um, this happens because, um, this happens because, uh, the way"
354480,358300," we manage the notes, right?"
358300,361760," Or rather the, the volume of notes, right?"
361760,364220," So this is essentially the time."
364220,369200," And this is the, I don't know, some sort of like a pressure, but I don't know, because this"
369200,369900," is the sound wave."
369900,370500," Right."
370540,372080," So we need to play the beep, right?"
372080,374800," So we play the beep with a constant frequency, right?"
374800,380700," But if you just play the beep like that, uh, it will click on the edges of the beep, right?"
381280,389100," So what we do, we actually, uh, um, slowly fade in the beep, right?"
389100,390260," Very, very quickly."
390260,393740," Like, uh, but, but still slowly we smooth out this kind of thing."
393740,397180," And then we play for a particular time and then we fade out."
397180,404780," But since the beep is like around 100 milliseconds or 200 milliseconds, this is like a 5% of, uh,"
404780,405900," 100 milliseconds."
405900,408780," So it's basically 5 milliseconds, right?"
408780,412900," So the, the fade in is 5 milliseconds and fade out is around also 5 milliseconds."
412900,417280," So, and even though it happens quickly, it smoothes out that clicks."
417280,419000," But here's the interesting thing."
419000,425320," Uh, we don't handle the situation when you need to play overlapping beeps because we don't"
425320,428180," have any sort of mixing between them, right?"
428180,433060," When you want to play overlapping beeps, we basically abrupt the previous beep and start"
433060,435600," playing the new one, uh, with fade in and fade out."
435600,438540," And this is where the clicks, uh, sort of comes in."
438540,442640," And that's why it happens when there's two consequence overlapping beeps."
442640,444760," So that's the problem that we have right now."
444760,450300," And, uh, this is probably going to be the first bug that I'm going to try to fix today."
450300,452420," So fixing this bug is actually relatively simple."
452420,454560," You just implement the mixer, right?"
454560,458320," So, and, uh, you maintain the list of currently playing beeps."
458640,462420," And as you play them, you just basically add them together, right?"
462420,466180," So you add them together and, uh, everything will be smoothed out essentially."
466180,470500," So right now we have just like a single variable that can only maintain a single beep."
470500,475080," Uh, and, uh, yeah, every time you need to play another one, we just reset it and everything"
475080,476200," breaks, right?"
476200,478000," And that's why we, we hear it click."
478760,488300," So classical audio bug, classical audio bug, uh, so let me, let me see what we can do in here."
488300,502040," So, uh, so, uh, to MPEG for you, uh, so I'm going to go to the simulation of our nation and, uh, where do we have the beep in here?"
502040,507160," So the beep right now is handled right within the, uh, state of the simulation."
507160,509360," So here is the beep frequency that we maintain."
509360,515940," And here is the sort of like a time variable that we use to keep track of how much time has"
515940,518440," left to like to, to play the beep, like, right?"
518440,521800," So when this variable reaches the zero, we stop playing the beep."
521800,528600," So what I want to do, in fact, I want to introduce another entity, uh, something like a beeper, right?"
529240,534240," And beeper is basically going to be a structure that maintains a list of beeps, right?"
534240,536080," Uh, right."
536080,546560," And a single beep is going to be essentially this pair of variables, like how much time, the duration of the beep and, uh, the, the current frequency of the beep, right?"
546560,549340," So you have a beeper, which basically maintains the list of them."
549340,555640," And then if you want to play the current sound, you ask the beeper and it will mix everything together, right?"
555640,557800," So let's actually introduce also the beep."
558540,563780," So in here, we're going to have, uh, I suppose frequency, which is going to be F32, right?"
563780,569080," So because it's, uh, fractional frequency could be fractional, uh, and, uh, the duration, right?"
569080,571040," So the current duration is going to be F32."
571040,574120," I'm not sure if the duration is a good name for this kind of thing."
574120,576300," It's more of a, like a cool down, right?"
576300,579400," Uh, it's more of a cool down, but it is what it is."
580200,582460," So, and let's implement the beeper, right?"
582460,588020," So for the beeper, uh, I suppose we need to have something like a default implementation, right?"
588020,591340," Because I don't plan to have any special initialization for this thing."
591340,593380," So let's just have a default thing."
593380,603620," And, uh, for the beeper, we want to have, um, I guess a method that introduces a new beep, right?"
603700,609060," It introduces the new beep, uh, so it will just push that beep into the list of those things."
609060,615200," You provide the frequency, uh, F32 and the duration of the beep, uh, right?"
615560,619980," And what it will do, it will just put this entire thing into the list of beeps, right?"
619980,621580," So we're just pushing this entire thing here."
621580,623740," So frequency and duration."
623740,624320," There we go."
624320,625260," We pushed everything there."
625260,632340," So, and the next thing we need to do, we need to have a function that accepts the sound buffer, right?"
632340,639620," It accepts the sound buffer and plays all of the current beeps in that specific sound buffer."
639620,641100," So that's what we need in here."
641200,649320," So right now we accept the sound buffer somewhere in here, in, uh, um, in a state update and sound"
649320,653440," buffer is basically an array of floating points and also a sample rate, right?"
653440,658800," So basically how many of these numbers per second, uh, do we have, right?"
658800,665640," So, and because of that, this sound buffer like implicitly defines the, uh, time range, right?"
665640,670100," And the timer should be equal to Delta time, but I'm not 100% sure about that."
670160,674940," I'm not 100% sure if that has to be the, uh, the time range and the synchronization between"
674940,678000," the video and audio in this project is kind of wonky right now."
678000,682480," So, but I think, uh, it's, it's going to become better as we introduce the mixer, right?"
682480,687600," Because maybe the time, the current time of the simulation and the current time of the mixer"
687600,689440," are going to be like slightly different things."
689440,693320," But because of that, there could be maybe like, uh, desynchronizations between them."
693320,696560," Um, so it's kind of, I'm sorry if it was too loud."
696560,700360," Um, it's kind of, yeah, it's kind of strange, but it is what it is."
700360,708540," Because we, for the sound, we want to maintain the audio in like integers, right?"
708540,714440," I mean, for the sound, we want to maintain the current time in integers, because that's"
714440,718640," going to be the amount of samples since the beginning of, uh, application."
718640,723900," But for the simulation, we want to maintain the time in, uh, in seconds and in fractional"
723900,724900," parts of the seconds."
724900,731740," So, kind of like a, um, state simulation and sound simulation, they have a slightly different"
731740,732260," resolutions."
732260,737360," And, uh, the question is, do we need to synchronize the resolution somehow?"
737360,739140," Maybe yes."
739140,744280," I think it does make sense to synchronize the resolutions because over time they may become"
744280,745560," very much distinct."
745560,748320," If you know what I'm talking about, right?"
748320,753180," So, and which brings us to very interesting conclusion."
753320,760320," Like the whole simulation has to be synchronized to the size of the sound buffer, uh, which"
760320,765320," is kind of strange, but that's what the code wants to do."
765320,766740," You know what I'm talking about?"
766740,773260," Sometimes, like, you write the code, but the code wants to be like this particular thing."
773260,779020," And it's really difficult to make the code turn around and do something else."
779020,781980," It's just like the code wants to be this way, right?"
782060,788640," And right now the code wants to synchronize the video and audio by the size of the audio"
788640,791260," buffer, which is really strange."
791260,795220," But okay, maybe we can go in that direction and see what kind of problems it will introduce."
795220,819720," So, we're going to take the self and then we're going to take the sound and this is going to be something like F32 and this is going to be sound sample rate, right?"
820620,823200," and it's going to be size, right?"
823200,826020," And the question is, what are we going to be doing in here?"
826020,829460," Um, that's a very, very good question."
831620,838320," So, I suppose we're going to be iterating through each individual beep."
838320,856960," So, maybe we're going to be going through each individual sample and within each individual sample, we are iterating all the current beeps and constantly mixing them up."
856960,883640," So, duration and duration because of that could be in, well, we can change the sample rate at any point."
883640,899240," So, to play the beeps, yeah, you can easily speed up or slow down the sound by changing the sample rate."
899240,907020," So, because of that, we don't want the sound to be of a particular sample rate, if that makes any sense."
907020,914340," So, yeah, it's kind of like the entire system is kind of meh, but I guess I shouldn't really worry about that."
914340,922120," So, the entire system that I'm trying to build turns out really, really gross to be fair."
922120,923280," I don't know how to explain that."
923280,925300," It's just like doesn't look elegant at all."
926260,928780," But maybe I shouldn't care about it right now."
928780,931160," Maybe I shouldn't worry about it right now."
931160,934140," So, I just need to implement something that is working, right?"
934140,939720," And then maybe I'll have enough information to make it more elegant and like just also see what kind of problems I have."
939720,939980," Yeah."
939980,942820," So, it's kind of the problem that I always stuck with."
942820,947900," Like something turns out really gross and I don't know how to make it better, but maybe I shouldn't care."
947980,949540," Maybe I should just implement this entire thing."
949540,951100," Right."
951100,957080," Anyway, so, let's iterate through this entire thing."
957080,961580," So, we're going to be iterating through the samples."
961580,965840," So, this is a sample rate, then a sample count."
965840,971040," So, let's call this like this."
971040,971940," Samples."
971940,973140," This is going to be samples."
973140,975300," And this is going to be sample rate."
975300,979160," So, we're iterating samples like this."
979160,985360," And within each individual sample, we are basically iterating the beeps."
985360,985800," Right."
985800,987820," For beep in self beeps."
987820,988560," Right."
988560,991260," And I need to iterate it like this."
991260,1002220," So, and what I need to do for that specific sample."
1002220,1002640," Right."
1002640,1004600," I probably need to initialize it to zero."
1004600,1005000," Right."
1005120,1006360," So, we're initializing it to zero."
1006360,1015040," And then, I'm going to be adding something like beep update with a particular delta time."
1015040,1015580," Right."
1015580,1017620," Update with a particular delta time."
1017620,1026160," With a particular delta time."
1026160,1029200," But maybe it shouldn't be a delta time."
1029200,1029820," Rather."
1031140,1034780," Because I also need to know the global direction and whatnot."
1034780,1038120," Global time."
1038120,1039160," I mean, not global direction."
1039160,1039840," Global time."
1039840,1043920," So, because of that, maybe beep shouldn't have any methods."
1043920,1046840," I think any methods in here are going to be pretty much redundant."
1046840,1047900," Right."
1047900,1048860," So, we have a duration."
1048860,1050240," So, this is the delta time."
1050240,1054720," And the delta time is essentially the sample step."
1054720,1055200," Right."
1055300,1056760," It's a sample step."
1056760,1063500," And the sample step is something like one divided by sample rate."
1063500,1064540," Right."
1064540,1068040," Sample rate as F32."
1068040,1068760," There we go."
1068840,1070000," So, this is the sample step."
1070000,1071840," And."
1071840,1082740," So, I need to figure out the volume."
1082740,1086060," So, I probably need to start copy pasting the code from here."
1086060,1086740," Right."
1086820,1088220," So, this is the sample count."
1088220,1102620," So, this is the part of the global time."
1102620,1109600," So, then we have this thing where we have a beep duration."
1111660,1115380," And so on and so forth."
1115380,1124340," So, we want to have a global time."
1124340,1125020," Right."
1125020,1126580," We want to have a global time."
1126580,1130420," So, let's try to support the global time in here."
1130420,1131460," So, it's going to be F32."
1131460,1132720," Here is the global time."
1132720,1134380," Right."
1134380,1139500," This is the global time."
1141660,1144740," So, we iterate through all of the beeps."
1144740,1150800," And if the current beep duration is greater than zero."
1150800,1151340," Right."
1151340,1155580," That means then we want to actually play this entire thing."
1155580,1155860," Right."
1155860,1161760," So, we're basically going to be ignoring all of the beeps that already, you know, finished playing."
1161760,1165680," And after that, we'll have to remove all of the dead beeps."
1165680,1166340," Right."
1166900,1174560," So, is there any way in Rust to filter out everything, but actually in a mutable way?"
1174560,1176200," Right."
1176200,1180600," So, basically, remove everything that fits the particular predicate."
1183860,1188220," So, I know that there's probably filter and stuff like that."
1188220,1193740," So, there's a retain."
1193740,1196220," The element specifies by the predicate."
1196220,1196480," Okay."
1196480,1197700," So, that's literally retain."
1197700,1198260," Right."
1198260,1200240," So, retain everything."
1200240,1201200," So, and it's mutable."
1201200,1201440," Okay."
1201440,1202440," So, that's literally what I need."
1202440,1207160," So, it's going to be self beeps retain everything."
1207160,1213320," So, this is going to be the beep whose duration is greater than zero."
1213320,1215160," So, that's basically what we have in here."
1215160,1224940," So, we're going to be iterating through the entire beeps, ignoring everything that is like, that is already done."
1224940,1229120," And then, everything that is done is going to be removed at the end of the update."
1229120,1229640," Right."
1231820,1235320," It's going to be removed at the end of the update."
1235320,1236740," Okay."
1236740,1240620," So, this is a sample state, sample."
1240620,1248020," And for the particular beep, what we're doing, essentially."
1248020,1248640," Right."
1248640,1251440," So, we're going to be doing that thing."
1251440,1253960," Right."
1253960,1258600," Where, so, the T is the current time, if I understand correctly."
1258600,1259000," Right."
1259000,1260920," It is the current time."
1262240,1262640," Yeah."
1262640,1263000," Okay."
1263000,1264100," So, it's the current time."
1264100,1266500," So, that means I can probably use the global time."
1266500,1267040," Right."
1267040,1268360," So, this is a global time."
1268360,1272020," Then, I can use the beep frequency."
1272020,1274480," So, this is a very long thing."
1274480,1279020," Might as well actually just replace it with pi and just do something like use this thing."
1279020,1279620," Right."
1279620,1281940," So, because I don't want to like screw up this entire formula."
1281940,1289320," So, 2 pi of beep frequency multiplied by the global time."
1289320,1289560," Okay."
1289680,1292900," So, then we take sine and then we take the global beep volume."
1292900,1298380," So, that's basically the value of the sample that we need to add to the current sample."
1298380,1298920," Right."
1298920,1299380," There we go."
1299380,1302220," So, that's basically what we need to add."
1304100,1306140," So, and I'm not sure."
1306140,1308860," Can I actually simplify this to just time?"
1308860,1309940," Right."
1309940,1311240," So, this is going to be global time."
1311240,1312020," This is time."
1312020,1316980," This is how much time has passed since the beginning of the application or not."
1317480,1324820," And after we did all of that, I'm going to increment the time by the sample step."
1324820,1325320," Right."
1325320,1328420," Sample step."
1328420,1329340," There we go."
1329340,1333880," So, that's basically the sample step."
1335060,1339620," And we're already mixing up all of the necessary beeps in here."
1339620,1339860," Right."
1339860,1341740," So, that's the code of the mixer."
1341740,1342600," Right."
1342600,1344340," So, we go through all of the samples."
1344340,1347760," And for each sample, for each beep, we're just mixing everything up."
1347760,1349020," Right."
1349020,1355840," And I suppose also for each individual beep, as we process the beep, we need to take the duration"
1355840,1358020," of the beep and subtract the sample step."
1358020,1358820," Right."
1358820,1359660," The sample step."
1359660,1361520," So, yeah."
1361520,1367300," Subtracting the sample step."
1367300,1371980," And that will allow us to have overlapping beeps and stuff like that."
1371980,1378780," So, and now I need to handle the fade in and fade out of the entire system."
1378780,1381180," So, and I had a fade in and fade out somewhere here."
1382180,1390320," Where, yeah, essentially the current duration divided by the beep duration."
1390320,1390580," Okay."
1390580,1392700," So, the entire code actually simplifies everything."
1392700,1395200," So, I'm going to just copy paste it into that stuff."
1395200,1395580," Right."
1395580,1396980," I'm copy pasting it in here."
1396980,1398460," Right."
1398460,1408180," And so, here what I need to do is essentially take the beep duration."
1408580,1409020," Right."
1409020,1412140," And divide it by the, like, a maximum beep duration."
1412140,1412660," Right."
1412660,1419080," So, that will give me the percentage of how much has played since the beginning of this thing."
1419080,1427780," And then, depending on what edges we are, so we are at the beginning or at the end, we're"
1427780,1429600," basically adjusting the current volume."
1429780,1434400," So, this is basically something like fader, or I don't know how, if that's a good name for"
1434400,1435040," this kind of thing."
1435040,1439460," But we basically use this thing to multiply the nodes together."
1439460,1440080," Right."
1440080,1443900," And that is basically it."
1443900,1446680," I think that is basically it."
1454680,1457340," That should be the beeper."
1457340,1459280," That should be the beeper."
1459280,1464440," So, it would be also nice to extract out this magical constant, 005."
1464440,1468700," And 005 stands for, like, 5% of fade in and fade out."
1468700,1474760," So, essentially, this is the, you know, the percentage of the node."
1474760,1477360," So, because when we start playing the node, we fade in."
1477360,1478900," Then we play the node."
1479060,1480100," And then we fade out."
1480100,1483180," And that percentage is the, this is the 5%."
1483180,1485820," And for the 5% of the time, it will be fading in."
1485820,1488240," And for the 5% of the time, it will be fading out."
1488240,1491420," Maybe percentage is not particularly great for this particular case."
1491420,1495760," Because the longer the node, the more fading in and fading out will happen."
1495760,1498220," So, maybe this is not what we want."
1498220,1502380," But we don't really have different lengths of nodes right now."
1502380,1504180," So, I don't really care about it too much."
1504180,1505980," So, I think we can leave it as it is."
1505980,1508800," Because I don't really want to mess with already working code."
1510040,1510560," Okay."
1510560,1512740," So, let's actually try to compile the internet, I think."
1512740,1515880," And see if it's, you know, compiled or not."
1515880,1517960," Rastc main.rs"
1517960,1523180," So, this one, okay."
1523180,1528220," Cannot assign because we are actually not iterating the beeps in a mutable fashion."
1528220,1528640," Okay."
1528640,1529900," So, let's actually do iter mute."
1529900,1533380," And everything seems to be okay."
1533380,1533980," Right."
1533980,1534840," So, yeah."
1534840,1536020," First, almost first try."
1536020,1537860," Almost first try compile the internet thing."
1538360,1540760," Didn't even upset the borrow checker."
1540760,1541540," Would you look at that?"
1541540,1544680," Isn't that amazing fellow Rast developers?"
1544680,1546680," Okay."
1546680,1550180," So, because of that, I'm going to be actually introducing something like Beeper."
1550180,1553040," Which is just, you know, an instance of a Beeper."
1553040,1555760," And I don't think we need to keep track of these things anymore."
1555760,1556180," Right."
1556180,1558040," So, they are not very much important."
1562580,1566040," So, this is going to be the sound and a sound rate."
1566040,1570760," So, I was actually contemplating the other day."
1570760,1575720," Do I want to separate playing the sound and updating the simulation?"
1576560,1587320," Since I introduced this, like a Beeper thing, this mixer, Beeper mixer, I think now it does make sense to separate playing the sound and updating the simulation."
1587540,1589400," So, maybe this is precisely what I'm going to be doing."
1589400,1589980," Right."
1589980,1592740," I'm going to be introducing this thing like sound."
1592740,1593580," Right."
1593580,1596780," Which accepts mutable self because it's going to be updating things."
1596780,1600560," And it's going to accept samples."
1600560,1601000," Right."
1601060,1606100," So, this is the samples F32 and the sample rate."
1606100,1607660," So, it's going to be use size."
1607660,1609360," There we go."
1609360,1612920," So, and the main update method is not going to be accepting anything."
1612920,1613800," Right."
1613800,1616540," So, and for the entire simulation, there are three steps."
1616540,1616980," Right."
1616980,1618360," Rendering the current state."
1618360,1620340," Playing the current sound."
1620340,1623020," Updating to the next step of the animation."
1623020,1624320," You see?"
1624320,1625940," So, yeah."
1625940,1627280," That's essentially going to be the thing."
1630660,1633500," And maybe this is where..."
1633500,1634320," Oh, shit."
1634320,1639360," That actually gives me a pretty cool idea on how to update the..."
1639360,1641340," How to synchronize video in the sound."
1641340,1643320," You see, in..."
1643320,1646580," When we mix in the sounds, we actually update its global time."
1646580,1650640," But what if we don't update its global time?"
1650640,1653380," What if we pretend that we're updating it in here?"
1653380,1656920," But once we've finished playing the thing for that specific samples,"
1656920,1659960," we just roll back to its original value."
1660260,1665100," And we only update the global time in the..."
1665100,1668100," In the update."
1668100,1671760," And that way, we kind of synchronize everything with everything."
1671760,1677440," But it's going to be kind of difficult because we'll have to pretend that we're updating time for the duration as well."
1677440,1679100," So, it's not particularly great."
1679100,1680680," So, I don't know."
1680920,1685180," Okay, I'm still thinking about this problem, like, on how to synchronize properly video and audio."
1685760,1687560," And I'm still not sure how to do that."
1687560,1688420," I'm still not sure."
1688420,1691820," Anyway, so, a lot of this code is not important anymore."
1691820,1696140," There's still clicks that are overlapping probably because of the way..."
1696140,1696600," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1696600,1699680," So, basically, this is the problem that we're working on right now."
1700140,1701540," And there we go."
1701540,1705280," So, what is going on?"
1705280,1707020," So, can I just remove this entire thing?"
1707020,1707220," Okay."
1708980,1710900," And we don't need to update the global time."
1710900,1712280," We don't have a global time anymore."
1712280,1716540," So, this is a beeper height."
1716540,1717320," Okay."
1717320,1718420," So, I removed everything."
1718420,1722420," And let's go through the compilation errors and see what we need to fix in here."
1722420,1726060," So, as you can see here, we're not doing this kind of shit anymore, right?"
1726320,1731120," So, we need to move updating of the sound to a different place."
1731120,1742000," So, state sound, play the sound into the buffer, right?"
1742000,1745360," And then save the sound in here and then update the state."
1745360,1746300," Yeah, there we go."
1746300,1747020," That's actually pretty cool."
1747020,1751200," So, here we are basically doing the rendering, right?"
1751200,1754000," So, we fill up the canvas on which we're rendering the frame."
1754300,1757400," We're rendering the current frame of the state into the canvas."
1757400,1763180," We're converting the frame into the corresponding color space that is supported by the video format."
1763180,1764440," And we're saving that frame."
1764440,1768180," So, these four commands are related to saving the frame."
1768180,1771540," Then we have a similar symmetric situation for the sound, right?"
1771540,1773260," We clean up the sound buffer."
1773260,1778040," Then we ask the state, please fill up the sound buffer with the currently playing sound."
1778040,1782380," And we're saving that sound buffer into a separate sound file."
1782680,1785460," And then we're updating to the next step of the animation."
1785460,1789260," And we repeat that until we render the required amount of frames."
1789260,1790940," So, everything is separated in here."
1790940,1794740," Video, audio, next state."
1794740,1796680," Video, audio, next state."
1796680,1797760," Video, audio, next state."
1797760,1799880," So, pretty straightforward, pretty simple."
1799880,1800300," Okay."
1800300,1801660," So, what else do we have in here?"
1801660,1803600," Global time."
1803600,1804480," We don't have a global time."
1804480,1805440," We don't have any of this shit."
1805620,1810440," So, self, it's not a beeper."
1810440,1811460," Oh, we don't have a beeper."
1811460,1812820," Let's actually do something like beeper."
1812820,1814860," Beeper default."
1814860,1815480," Right."
1815480,1817000," So, this is going to be beeper default."
1817000,1828900," So, and in here, when you want to play the beep, what we have to do, essentially, is beeper."
1829140,1833340," Self, beeper beep, and we have to provide the frequency."
1833340,1836840," So, I suppose I should have not removed the beeper frequency."
1836840,1839980," Because, as you can see, we keep updating it."
1839980,1844160," Because every time you bounce off the wall, you have to increase it by 20."
1844260,1845480," So, we'll have to bring it back."
1845480,1848520," And then, we're going to be using beep duration to play the beeper."
1848520,1848960," Right."
1848960,1854140," So, as you can see, here, we detected that we bounce off of the wall."
1854140,1857700," We bounce the rectangle, and we schedule the beep into the mixer."
1857700,1858680," Right."
1858680,1861860," So, let's take a look at the beep frequency."
1861860,1864180," Beep frequency is going to be F32."
1864180,1871040," And, originally, it's going to be the, you know, 440 hertz, I think."
1871040,1872760," Beep frequency."
1873140,1875380," And this is going to be beep frequency."
1875380,1876200," There we go."
1876200,1876800," There we go."
1876800,1878020," So, here is a beep frequency."
1878020,1880220," Okay, go."
1880220,1882180," So, let's try to compile the entire thing."
1882180,1883300," And is it compiling?"
1883300,1884220," It seems to be compiling."
1884220,1885380," First try, by the way."
1885380,1887860," Didn't even upset the borrow checker."
1887860,1890460," All right."
1890460,1891140," All right."
1891140,1891580," All right."
1891580,1892040," All right."
1892040,1892560," All right."
1892560,1896620," So, let's actually try to generate this entire shit and see how miserably we'll fail."
1896620,1900140," If it compiles..."
1900140,1906180," It works."
1906180,1909800," So, how's it going to run?"
1909800,1914380," So, that's supposed to fix..."
1914380,1924240," Oh, already it's working."
1924240,1924600," Okay."
1924600,1929020," Hands up."
1929020,1930680," Hands up."
1938120,1939600," To impact for you."
1939600,1940320," Yes."
1940320,1942280," That's the name of the project we're doing."
1942280,1943480," Almost."
1943480,1944400," Almost."
1944400,1945620," Almost the name of the project."
1945620,1952600," I can't hear shit in this mist."
1954280,1955560," One more time."
1955560,1959360," So, I'll put mp4."
1959360,1961960," It doesn't play shit."
1961960,1963860," We screwed up, chat."
1963860,1966400," We straight up screwed up."
1966400,1974320," If it compiles, it works, by the way."
1974320,1976060," If it compiles, it works."
1976060,1977520," False advertisement."
1977520,1979180," False advertisement."
1979180,1981280," I'm calling it false advertisement on this one."
1981280,1984600," Why my program compiled, but didn't work?"
1984600,1985400," Look."
1985400,1986600," Look, look, look."
1986600,1987520," Chat, chat, chat."
1987520,1988360," What the fuck?"
1988360,1994360," So, grep rn recursive grep with all of the numbers."
1994360,1995900," All of the nine numbers."
1995900,1997400," And I'm looking for unsafe."
1997400,2002760," There is no..."
2002760,2003760," Well..."
2003760,2006660," Wait a second."
2006660,2011660," There is unsafe in a binary file, but there is no..."
2011660,2012540," What the fuck?"
2012540,2018200," There is no single unsafe keyword in my entire source code."
2018200,2023800," But the executable that got generated by the compiler does have unsafe."
2024360,2026920," Wait a second."
2026920,2033060," Does the Rust compiler embeds unsafe code into my executable?"
2033060,2043920," So, that's why it doesn't work."
2043920,2045700," So, that's the reason."
2045700,2048340," We need to report a bug."
2048340,2054340," Somebody please report a bug that Rust compiler embeds unsafe code into my executable."
2054360,2055040," My executable."
2055040,2061180," If Rust is safe, why the fuck do I have unsafe in my executable?"
2061180,2061800," What the fuck?"
2061800,2063340," Anyway."
2063340,2067300," So, we need to understand what the fuck is going on."
2067300,2072300," I'm not sure what the fuck is going on, but something fucking is going on."
2072300,2076160," So, where is my music?"
2076160,2078240," Let's keep playing music."
2078240,2085380," I wonder if we have anything interesting in the sound file."
2085380,2088280," Because we generate the sound in a separate sound file."
2088360,2091540," If I do something like hex edit, I'll put VCM."
2091540,2095760," And as you can see, it's all filled with zeros."
2095760,2096520," Right?"
2096520,2100800," So, if we go through the entire audio file."
2100800,2102740," Nowhere at any point."
2102740,2108220," Nowhere at any point it is filled with anything."
2108380,2110580," So, the entire thing is literally zero."
2110580,2113560," Start over."
2113560,2114640," Subscribe."
2114640,2116200," It is Safi and Safi."
2116200,2118000," It is Safi and Safi."
2118000,2120280," Thank you so much for five months of tier one subscription."
2120280,2121240," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
2121240,2123980," And welcome to our epic safe club."
2125760,2155240," So, I suppose the entire thing that it saves in here is actually empty."
2155240,2157600," So, so far I didn't see any sound."
2157600,2161140," Right?"
2161140,2162900," It literally didn't generate anything."
2162900,2167040," So, because I presume knowing like..."
2167040,2170900," We are already like more than halfway through the whole file."
2170900,2172360," And we haven't seen anything."
2172360,2179860," So, that might be the problem."
2179860,2181580," That might be the problem."
2182200,2186660," And all of that because of the goddamn unsafe keyword in my executable."
2188080,2190880," Who the fuck put unsafe keyword in my executable?"
2190880,2193880," That's literally the reason why it happened."
2193880,2195060," We found it."
2195060,2196020," Anyway."
2196020,2197920," So, let me see."
2197920,2200400," So, what do we have in here?"
2201200,2202760," So, we fill everything with zero."
2202760,2204860," And then we ask the state to do the sound."
2204860,2206600," And if I take a look at the simulation."
2206600,2208220," And sound..."
2208220,2208940," Oh, okay."
2208940,2209980," That explains everything."
2213740,2214300," All right."
2214300,2216380," So, anyway."
2216380,2217500," Let's ignore that never happened."
2217500,2219580," Update."
2219580,2221400," Sample."
2221400,2222200," Sample."
2222200,2222800," All right."
2222800,2223440," All right."
2223440,2224180," So, let's see."
2224180,2225420," This entire thing compiled."
2225420,2228320," RST."
2228320,2229720," And RS."
2229720,2231440," Okay."
2231440,2232480," So, is it compiled?"
2232480,2233660," It seems like it's compiling."
2233820,2240720," okay so let's just generate this entire shit uh so to be fair i i kind of don't like that it starts"
2240720,2245200," playing uh right away right now so maybe i'm gonna enable that a little bit later so i'm gonna just"
2245200,2248300," you know run the entire thing and see how it goes"
2248300,2257820," all right all right all right all right all righty all righty all righty all righty righty"
2263820,2278320," okay so it's ready oh it also needs to convert this shit all right"
2278320,2288360," all right ffmpeg kicks in and we're handling this shit at 60 fps would you look at that"
2288360,2292720," uh handling that shit at 60 fps"
2292720,2303640," all right so prepare your ears we're about to hear something so and let's see if the actual"
2303640,2308800," like uh click on the consequent overlapping beeps has been fixed"
2308800,2330100," they you can clearly see that they're overlapping and they're not really clipping but there's"
2330100,2338860," something weird with them oh i know what exactly is weird with them because the every time we bounce"
2338860,2347040," off of this thing we increment the frequencies so the consequent beeps they dissonate with each other"
2347040,2356080," yes so yeah i think it's actually pretty good right so that's precisely what we want to have but we can"
2356080,2362440," try to actually increase the step of the frequency a little bit to make it sound maybe a little bit more"
2362440,2366780," pleasant because that's roughly what uh what we wanted so that's roughly what needs to be happening"
2366780,2373340," uh so i think uh so what if let's actually do it like this we have to like increase the frequency um"
2373340,2380940," correctly uh according to like music theory or something like that so maybe we'll have to write"
2380940,2388780," a function that accepts the number of the note on the like you know classical like uh western scale"
2388780,2402780," and convert it to a frequency so we can increment things not by the frequencies but by their note"
2406780,2420780," um um"
2420780,2434780," um"
2436780,2442140," um"
2442140,2448380," so uh what do we have in here is going to be output mp4"
2448380,2465260," it's kind of dangerous not gonna lie so uh yeah i suppose we have to uh basically convert"
2465900,2471900," like increment the frequency not by just some sort of like a random value that we chose but by actually"
2471900,2478860," uh note and as far as i know notes uh they're not uh linear right so there's a particular formula to"
2478860,2487100," that but i do have the formula saved in my husky uh like music in husky video right so uh"
2487100,2488940," two two two"
2492380,2519340," um um so music in husky um so okay so here is the video where i actually explained all of that uh you"
2519340,2523260," can find it in here if you're interested and of course for people who's watching on youtube i'm"
2523260,2531420," going to put it in here uh right uh music in husky uh video right there we go and uh in the description"
2531420,2540220," i think i also left uh the uh link to the to the note math right so here is basically the formula that"
2540220,2545980," you can use the basic formula for the frequencies of the notes of the equal tempered scale i guess that's"
2545980,2551980," what it's called that's the official name for this thing is fn f0 f0 is the frequency of one fixed"
2551980,2561180," node which must be defined a common choice it's a so yeah it's gonna 440 um right so and a is the 12th"
2561180,2568220," root of 2 the number which is multiplied by itself 12 times equal to this um specific thing okay so uh"
2568220,2574140," yeah and we just need to implement that formula in rust and just plug it in and that should work because"
2574140,2580380," that's precisely the formula that i used in the video and it worked really well it allowed me to"
2580380,2585980," actually like make uh different tunes and melodies and stuff like that so and of course i'm going to"
2585980,2591020," leave that link in the description as well for people who's interested in this kind of stuff so um yeah"
2591020,2600140," i guess i remember wait a second i remember that uh also in the comments i left a link to means physics"
2600140,2608700," video uh that kind of explains the uh the math behind that formula i think yeah as we discussed on the"
2608700,2613980," premiere in the chat i mean physics has a video explaining two to the power of one over 12 in uh"
2613980,2619340," the semi-transverse formula right so that's the video and i don't remember how exactly it was"
2619340,2623180," explained in there so maybe we can take a look at that video right on the stream so if you guys don't"
2623180,2631580," mind because i think it's gonna be oh my god youtube the sound of youtube should have a computer okay so"
2631580,2641660," uh here is the video uh so why is it impossible to tune a piano right so um okay this is going to be"
2641660,2653500," this thing uh so math note frequencies math right and this is the video why it is impossible to tune a"
2653500,2660860," piano right something like this uh right and we can watch it because i i kind of want to refresh the the"
2660860,2666540," knowledge about that uh because that information was not really useful for me so i forgot it really quickly"
2667900,2677260," so yeah animal intestines i'm and ah the sound of shaking animal intestines i mean strings which are"
2677260,2681420," traditionally made out of cat gut but regardless of what it's made out of when a string vibrates"
2681420,2689100," the it does so with the ends fixed to the instrument this means that it can only vibrate in certain ways"
2689100,2695260," sine waves like a jump rope with one bump or two bumps or three or four or some combination of these bumps"
2695260,2700380," the more bumps the higher the pitch and the faster the string has to vibrate in fact the frequency of a"
2700380,2705420," string's vibration is exactly equal to the number of bumps times the string's fundamental frequency"
2705420,2710540," that is the frequency of vibrations for a single bump and since most melodious instruments use either"
2710540,2715580," strings or air vibrating in pipes which has the same sinusoidal behavior it won't surprise you to hear"
2715580,2719900," that musicians have different names for the different ratios between these pitches in the traditional"
2719900,2725660," western scale one to two bumps is called an octave two to three is a perfect fifth three to four is a"
2725660,2730620," perfect fourth then a major third minor third some other things that aren't in the scale and from eight"
2730620,2736620," to nine bumps is a major second or whole step if you play a few of these notes together you get the nice"
2736620,2742860," sound of perfect harmony hence the name for this pattern of pitches harmonics in fact a sound that matches one"
2742860,2747900," of the harmonics of a string can cause that string to start vibrating on its own with a resonant ringing"
2747900,2753660," sound and a bugle playing taps uses only the notes in a single series of harmonics which is part of why"
2753660,2758700," the melody of taps rings out so purely and why you can play taps with the harmonics of a single guitar"
2758700,2765020," string harmonics can also be used to tune string instruments for example on a violin viola or cello the"
2765020,2770060," third harmonic on one string should be equal to the second harmonic on the next string up bassists and"
2770060,2775020," guitarists can compare the fourth harmonic to the third harmonic on the next string up but then we"
2775020,2780460," come to the piano or historically the harpsichord or clavichord but either way the problem is this"
2780460,2786620," it has too many strings there's a string for each of the 12 semitones of the western scale times seven if"
2786620,2792380," you wanted to tune these strings using harmonics you could for example try using whole steps that is you"
2792380,2797500," could compare the ninth harmonic on one key to the eighth harmonic two keys up which works fine for the"
2797500,2802620," first few keys but if you do it six times you'll get to what's supposed to be the original note an"
2802620,2807820," octave up which should have twice the frequency except that our harmonic tuning method multiplied the"
2807820,2816460," frequency by a factor of nine eighths each time and nine over eight to the sixth is not two it's 2.027286529541"
2816460,2822700," etc if you tried harmonically tuning a piano using major thirds instead you'd multiply the frequency by five"
2822700,2829660," fourths three times or one point nine five three one two five still not two using fourths you'd get"
2829660,2835820," one point nine seven three not two fifths gives two point oh two seven again and don't even try using"
2835820,2842220," half steps you'll be off by almost ten percent and this is the problem it's mathematically impossible to"
2842220,2849100," tune a piano consistently across all keys using perfect beautiful harmonics so we don't most pianos these days"
2849100,2854300," use what's called equal tempered tuning where the frequency of each key is the 12th root of two times"
2854300,2859260," the frequency of the key below it the 12th root of two is an irrational number something you'd never"
2859260,2864620," get using the simple ratios of harmonic tuning but its benefit is that once you go up 12 keys you end"
2864620,2871180," up with exactly the 12th root of two to the 12th or twice the frequency a perfect octave however ah"
2872620,2879980," so yeah that makes sense out of two to the 12th or twice the frequency a perfect octave however the"
2879980,2885740," octave is the only perfect interval on an equally tuned piano fifths are slightly flat fourths are"
2885740,2891100," slightly sharp major thirds are sharp minor thirds are flat and so on you can hear a kind of wah wah wah"
2891100,2897820," wah wah wah wah effect in this equal tempered chord which goes okay i get it because of the piano all right so"
2898460,2905100," that's why you have two to the power of like one over 12th uh because it's yeah makes sense uh because"
2905100,2913580," basically what we're doing here we're effectively tuning the piano uh so yeah wow wow wow"
2919340,2930700," i think i'm going to make a small break by the way uh so all right"
2930700,2940620," i wish i learned this in school when they teach us some music theory i mean why why is this so time"
2940620,2948860," sensitive you can learn it now while learning things in school in the lame stupid school with stupid"
2948860,2955500," teachers when you can learn it right now in 2021 with the modern technologies on the internet watching"
2955500,2963900," some youtube videos just learn it now fuck schools really so school didn't teach me anything right so"
2963900,2969020," why would i even like worry about like why didn't i teach it's like it's cool i can turn all that"
2969020,2974220," shit myself i don't need school to learn shit all right so if i want to learn something i'm going to"
2974220,2979980," fucking learn that i don't need school for that all right so anyway uh let's make a small break um right"
2979980,2989180," and um all right let's continue so let's go ahead and implement this specific formula uh so as far as i"
2989180,2994140," know it should be pretty straightforward right so and another interesting thing about this formula is that"
2994140,3002860," it and can be negative right so that means you can have uh nodes below 440. uh so yeah let's just go ahead"
3002860,3009980," and do that um i'm gonna go to c dot rs and let's introduce the function uh that is called something"
3009980,3021740," like um i don't even know how to call such function to be fair so uh uh freck of note i guess it makes sense"
3021740,3027660," right so and in here we're going to accept the note i 32 and it will return the frequency of that specific"
3027660,3040940," note so and in here right so let's just take that uh so f0 so 400 and 40 multiplied by um a to the power"
3040940,3048780," of n and the question is can i just do something like poll um note right so something like this poll note"
3049580,3057180," and then i can say that a is essentially two to the power of one over 12 so that means it has to be"
3057180,3065500," something like uh two uh like this it is rough geographical thank you thank you so much for 26 oh"
3065500,3071660," my god that's that's that's a lot of months thank you so much for 26 a month of two one subscription"
3072780,3075820," really really really appreciate it so you've been watching me for so long"
3075820,3082860," uh thank you thank you thank you uh it's a long time okay"
3082860,3091820," and you you still watch me despite me not programming in haskell anymore this is actually kind of"
3091820,3098860," kind of respectful so uh all right that's pretty cool thank you thank you so much i really really appreciate"
3098860,3105980," that uh so 12 over 12 there we go and so that's basically the thing we want to have in here um"
3105980,3115820," interestingly enough maybe i can just chain this stuff together right uh like this and i guess that's"
3115820,3120620," the whole formula right i'm not sure if it's going to compile i probably have to uh convert node to"
3120620,3125660," float and not i'm not even sure if you can do power like that we'll see about that we'll see about that"
3126460,3135420," um okay so here's the power and uh can't call method power a numeric numeric float um so i suppose i"
3135420,3139740," have to do something like do i really have to put underscore in here that's really interesting"
3139740,3148060," gratsuko uh thank you so much didn't say anything i was hoping that tts is going to say something that"
3148060,3153020," didn't say anything thank you so much for three months of uh twitch prime subscription thank you thank you"
3153020,3159180," thank you really appreciate it um all right so f 33 um 32"
3159180,3166380," all right so there's associated function pov"
3166380,3175100," that is really strange why is it called pov and not just power"
3178060,3187260," um another one uh travis hartwell subscribed with twitch from your first subscription by the way thank"
3187260,3195020," you thank you thank you and welcome to epic subscribers club uh thank you thank you so much this is really"
3195020,3195500," strange"
3200700,3205820," thank you so much loop uh 327 thank you so much for tier one subscription four months by the way"
3205820,3214300," four months uh thank you so much so uh this is really strange so for some reason they have like a"
3214300,3222940," different uh naming convention for the power and power f um which i don't quite understand why"
3224220,3230460," all right so you can say it's kind of similar like in c right like in c where you have power for integers"
3230460,3237580," and power for floats but at the same time right so they're trying to separate uh on the level of the"
3237580,3245900," naming convention operations on integers and floats but here is the thing why there is no such thing as mod"
3246540,3258700," uh and modif and f mod right so for doing modular arithmetics on both integers and floats you can just"
3258700,3265980," use modular operator right so essentially for integers if x and two are integers it's going to be integer"
3265980,3274700," modular arithmetic and if uh both of them are floats it's going to be basically f mod f right so why"
3275420,3281100," rust does not separate the concept of modular arithmetic for integers and for floats on a"
3281100,3287660," level of naming convention but does separate these concepts for the power you see what i'm talking"
3287660,3295900," about because i i remember the other day i was looking for f mod f and i couldn't find it and then i"
3295900,3301420," realized that you have to use this modular operator so i assumed okay so the rust trying to be consistent"
3301420,3306780," across different kinds of numbers right so it doesn't matter what kind of number you have integer"
3306780,3314300," float if they have similar operations you can do them in a similar way right and i would expect the power"
3314300,3320460," to be called the same thing across different kinds of numbers as well so there's kind of a strange"
3320460,3326140," inconsistency in naming and stuff like that i think and this is the only case by the way i bumped into this"
3326140,3331740," kind of stuff in rust all the time where there's like these inconsistencies and these weird things"
3331740,3338380," like it's just like why uh if you're i thought you're following that convention but you're not"
3338380,3343340," following that convention now it's very weird um"
3348940,3355500," though the situation with naming convention in c is even worse than that than that right but c has"
3355500,3361340," a good excuse because it's a like a very old device language it has like a whole legacy baggage that it"
3361340,3366380," needs to carry around but rust had an opportunity to fix all that though all of that stuff isn't really"
3366380,3370860," important right all of that stuff isn't really important it's just like the other day i was trying"
3370860,3378620," to do things with modular arithmetics and i you know my guess was incorrect and i adjusted my guess and"
3378620,3383900," it's incorrect again so yeah it doesn't really matter it's it's it's uh nothing that important"
3383900,3387660," it's just like something uh something small that i notice in rest all the time"
3387660,3395340," so anyway it doesn't really matter all that really doesn't matter seriously it's just like"
3396060,3406780," whatever um okay so you have to use pov right over uh and let me take a look so this thing has to be"
3406780,3413260," f32 uh maybe there is a reason for that maybe you can rise it to the power of integer thingy maybe"
3413260,3421180," yeah whatever it doesn't really matter no more okay seems to be working uh seems to be working seems to"
3421180,3431420," be working so and now uh i'm not gonna have a frequency of the um the absolute frequency right"
3431420,3446220," so we're gonna have a frequency of ah beep note i32 thank you thank you so much uh so this is gonna be"
3446220,3452700," beep note and we're gonna start with them uh with zero right so we're gonna start with zero and every"
3452700,3460700," time you bump right we're gonna increment the note by one right we're gonna increment by one and uh what"
3460700,3469500," we're gonna do we're gonna do note uh freak of note self beep note all right there we go so that's basically"
3469500,3475820," what we're gonna do what we're gonna do in here and now it's gonna basically increment the note of the beep"
3475820,3481900," on the western scale right and we'll see how it goes uh all right already"
3490620,3504460," hello percolis i don't know how to pronounce it i said percolis because n looks like p in russian"
3504460,3512620," language like pet and i have a russian brain uh all right so we need to merge these things together"
3516620,3529500," are you a musician no not anymore at least"
3529500,3543500," uh all right so it's gonna be mp4"
3546860,3555020," okay so and now we can do something interesting uh so as far as i know this is half of a tones"
3555020,3562860," right so this is a half of a tone um yeah so it's a half of a tone but what if we increment by"
3562860,3568860," the whole tone if you know what i'm talking about what about the whole tone so let's actually set the"
3568860,3579180," duration for uh to something uh like you know smaller uh because we would wait uh for the rendering all day"
3581740,3601020," the whole tone scale yeah so it's used in like you know tails and stuff like that usually it's like"
3601020,3610860," it has a mystery sound"
3610860,3622700," the thing about the like a tone scale is that in soviet um in old soviet movies related to like stories and"
3622700,3629660," folk it's actually quite often used to like convey mystery and stuff like that so this is one of the"
3629660,3636540," things it's quite a thing uh because it's really good at it"
3636540,3646940," so i want to kind of increment this thing by something that is harmonizing if you know what i'm talking"
3646940,3652540," you know what i'm talking about"
3652540,3655740," so maybe"
3655740,3658940," one two"
3658940,3661180," one two three"
3661180,3662540," four"
3662540,3665420," or maybe even five"
3665420,3666540," fifth"
3666540,3668060," so maybe"
3668060,3671180," what about what about quintus"
3672060,3679580," uh so if i go like this so it's gonna be plus five but one of the things i want to try in fact is"
3679580,3686220," starting like a relatively low uh right what if we start so if we increment by five right"
3686220,3693820," so by by quintus um we can start like around minus 20 and i hope it's not going to be too low"
3694700,3700860," hopefully so like one 12 is going to be like one octave so another one"
3700860,3708380," 24. um yeah we can start like around here and uh let's see how it's going to sound like"
3709660,3723180," so it's probably uh it's going to be relatively low"
3723180,3728620," i hope it's not going to be too harsh on"
3730700,3737580," yeah it actually you know rises very very fast"
3737580,3746220," okay so i think we have uh all of the necessary building blocks to actually uh start doing something"
3746220,3751020," more complex right so for example having like hundreds of the rectangles and stuff like that"
3751020,3759660," right so um yeah i think we straight up fixed the bug right that i uh described at the beginning of"
3759660,3764940," the stream so there is no clicks anymore and we're also doing everything by notes right invest in"
3764940,3771900," scale uh so let's do a committee committee uh so this one is fixed so i removed it uh appropriately and"
3771900,3782780," so fix the sound bug and i'm going to push that right into the reaper and you can find the source"
3782780,3788060," code of this thing in the chat or if you're watching on youtube you can find this stuff in the description"
3788060,3792060," right so the source code is like the second link in the description"
3792060,3800220," all right so uh let's go ahead and introduce something right so let's go ahead and introduce"
3800220,3806060," something interesting so let's go back to the complex version right but let's not uh play any"
3806060,3811420," notes yet right let's not play anything uh right now let's just uncomment the original one"
3811980,3818540," right and let's just generate uh the original version with a lot of uh rectangles and whatnot let's just"
3818540,3827260," see how it's going to look like"
3827260,3831260," so it's going to be very very interesting"
3834380,3853820," okay okay so this is the original animation so uh yeah now you understand why i didn't introduce"
3853820,3859260," sound into this thing right away because there's a lot of shadows going on in here so and imagine like"
3859260,3867020," playing a beep on each rectangle collision all right so well you don't need to imagine we are about to do"
3867020,3874540," it right now uh so let me see how we can do that uh so here we know for a fact if we reached sort of"
3874540,3882940," like this uh state right this execution um we collided with something so we need to um"
3883900,3890460," yeah we need to push a new beep right we need to push a new beep and the beep will probably depend"
3890460,3897420," on the rectangle right the beep probably will depend on the rectangle but i'm not 100 sure"
3897420,3906620," so and i wanted to do it so depending on the size of the rectangle uh you play different beeps"
3907340,3915100," right but uh i don't didn't want to make this dependency like a random right i wanted the uh"
3915100,3921420," you know sizes of different rectangles to harmonize in some particular sense right so uh how are we going"
3921420,3929180," to be doing all of that so i think we can store the beep node inside of the rectangle itself i think"
3929180,3934780," that's going to be a good idea right so we start the beep node in the rectangle itself and every time"
3934780,3940940," you collide the rectangle collides you play that note and every time you split the rectangle you"
3940940,3945580," increment that note by something that will harmonize with the previous rectangle if you know what i'm"
3945580,3952540," talking about right so that's going to be the idea uh okay so we're going to start something with like"
3952540,3960860," note and uh it's going to be just i32 right so here's the note and when you construct a rectangle you'll"
3960860,3965420," have to specify it and once you split the rectangle we're going to take the note and it's going to be"
3965420,3974060," self note plus um let's actually do four four actually harmonizes relatively well as well uh but it"
3974060,3981100," doesn't grow as fast as five well it still grows pretty fast but uh i don't know we'll see we'll see"
3981100,3988300," okay so every time you split we increment that note and uh yeah there we go so let's actually go to the"
3988300,3994300," the compilation errors uh missing a note and we're going to be starting with them with which note uh"
3994300,4000300," minus 24. yeah let's actually start with minus 24 and see how it goes uh so we don't need a beep"
4000300,4007340," note anymore uh let's go through the compilation errors in here uh two two two two so this one and"
4007340,4013980," let's remove this beep note from here it's not needed anymore uh and now every time i play i don't play just a"
4013980,4020300," beep note i'm playing the note from the rectangle itself right rectangle that we're about to remove"
4020300,4027740," and split does contain a node that you have to play uh while doing all that right and as you split split"
4027740,4033260," also automatically updates the note okay so everything actually fall into places all right this is actually"
4033260,4041500," pretty good uh okay uh anything all right so it's generating what's actually here uh get ready for an"
4041500,4047820," ear rape so uh take off your headphones so because it might get crazy right because we're gonna have a"
4047820,4055660," lot of sounds in here uh so i'm taking the risk right i'm taking a risk because i'm the streamer right"
4056540,4074860," but you don't have to uh you don't have to so be careful holy that's the coolest i've ever heard"
4074860,4080860," what the what the it was so cool oh my god i didn't expect it to be so cool"
4087020,4090940," i think we need to cut this to a particular the fuck"
4090940,4101020," uh i think we need to uh increase the threshold a little bit"
4101020,4106220," uh so what is the the rectangle so it's around like 10"
4106220,4114700," right it's around so after this size uh after this entire size the um oh boy"
4116540,4122140," the rectangle is considered dead and completely removed so width and height so this is actually"
4122140,4129820," the area right so this is 100 and this is also 100 but this is the area this is the area of the"
4129820,4143180," rectangle so uh and what's the factor reduction so essentially uh how quickly does it reduce so how many"
4143180,4149660," times it will do all of that so if you have the area the area is going to be 100 by 100 this one"
4149660,4157500," and if we multiply it by 90 how much does it uh actually decrease the entire thing i think it should"
4157500,4163260," decrease it a little bit faster than usual so if i take this kind of thing is that the same i don't"
4163260,4166940," think it's the same yeah it's actually like it decreases a little bit faster"
4168700,4174300," it actually decreases as a little bit faster so uh if i do this kind of stuff"
4174300,4178780," uh a couple of times right so"
4178780,4184380," okay so"
4184380,4189500," 81 another 81"
4191100,4200220," uh another 81 so at which what's going to be the uh actual thing that we want to put in here um"
4200220,4208220," so maybe i can just do the power in here right so let's actually try the power so i'm gonna do five"
4209020,4216700," and then six seven ten so you need to make like 10 of them"
4216700,4225180," so and we incrementing like a 10 times so it's actually kind of too much so i think i would say"
4225180,4237180," that the threshold of the area has to be around three five i think given the way we do things i think"
4237180,4243180," that's the most reasonable threshold to pull in here uh right so we'll see maybe i can even like"
4243180,4250060," put this uh like compute this kind of stuff based on the split reduce factor um right"
4250060,4254460," so uh let's see okay so let's actually compile it into i think"
4254460,4257100," um"
4257100,4263100," split reduce factor"
4265820,4270620," mm-hmm"
4270620,4285340," not bad uh so let's actually try to do this kind of thing"
4285340,4293980," um i don't know so we can take the rect width rect width as f32"
4295180,4303260," multiply by rect height uh as f32 right then we can take"
4303260,4317820," uh the split reduction thingy right split reduce factor um write it to the power of uh let's say 10"
4317820,4324860," but multiply by two right so this is how many times you can sort of split this entire thing and let's say"
4324860,4331020," say that we want to split it maybe like 15 times well i think i originally wanted 10. yeah that's"
4331020,4337260," basically what i want to have in here right uh so it's going to be f and this is going to be something"
4337260,4347500," like this okay uh let's see so it does not like that uh because you don't need any of this stuff"
4348700,4352940," uh unnecessary parenthesis uh unnecessary parenthesis that's that's that's very important thank you so"
4352940,4358860," much uh calls to constants are limited to cons function tipple structs okay so you cannot just do that"
4359980,4364060," uh annoying really really really annoying so"
4364060,4376220," um calls to constants uh constant function tipple so we need to pre-calculate this thing somehow differently"
4380220,4395020," um what a useful language i swear to get uh so um 100 by 100 uh multiplied by 90 to the power of"
4397500,4405340," to the power of 10 zozin you don't understand zozin it's difficult to have a consistent floating"
4405340,4414220," points between the platforms it's so hard zozin you don't understand it's very very hard problem it's very"
4414220,4427580," very very hard oh that's why you can't do that that's why you can't have a useful language zozin that's why you can't"
4427580,4436780," okay so let's take a look so it's it has to be uh something like this"
4436780,4441020," that's why you have to suffer because it's so hard"
4444220,4455340," Okay."
4474220,4492540," ""Was it too loud? It was actually kind of cool. But was it too loud? A little loud, a bit. Okay."
4492540,4503260," So, I have an idea. We can actually reduce the volume for the simulator. Bip volume."
4503900,4510860," So, what if I make this thing like half of its original volume? Do we even use b-volume? Yeah,"
4510860,4530060," we do use b-volume like this. Uh-huh. So, let's give it a try."
4533580,4540540," Mm-mm-mm."
4540540,4544540," Mm-mm-mm."
4544540,4546540," Mm-hmm."
4546540,4559500," Okay, let's not do that."
4559500,4567420," So, let me think how we can solve this kind of problem. So, it also starts clipping and"
4570460,4583420," we need to think how we can do that. I remember there were the ways to sort of not clip or anything like that."
4583420,4596380," Okay, we can put the volume around, like, one, right? Around one. And then, we basically increment"
4596380,4602380," everything in here, right? We increment everything. And then, what I want to do, I'm going to take the"
4602380,4607340," sample, right? I want to take the sample and I want to divide it by the amount of bips we have, right?"
4607340,4613340," So, that's one of the things we can do in here. Just divide it by the amount of bips."
4613340,4624300," So, because we stack them together and at some point it's going to become a problem, I suppose."
4624300,4633100," So, it would be kind of cool to actually do two iterations and retain only the bips that are, like,"
4633100,4640140," current. So, you don't divide too much, but it could become kind of slow. But we're not doing"
4640140,4644940," that in real time anyway, so I don't think we care about the performance right now. So, yeah,"
4644940,4649420," let's give it a try. Let's see if it's going to become better."
4649420,4658380," So, and maybe at some point we'll have to do something with the high pitch as well."
4658380,4666220," So, maybe we just don't want to grow very fast. Conversion failed."
4668700,4676860," The fuck? Input contains NAN. Oh, shit. So, this entire... Okay. So, this entire thing actually"
4676860,4684780," divided... Okay. That's very interesting. I see. So, we have a division by zero. So, that means if"
4684780,4691660," cell bips is greater than zero, only then let's do that. Okay. So, it's kind of interesting. So,"
4691660,4697260," ffmpeg actually helped us to find the bug, right? So, because you have like infinite or NAN usually when"
4697260,4703580," you divide by zero. So, relatively easy to catch. It's pretty cool."
4703580,4712700," Backseating. No backseating."
4727260,4744460," Hmm. It started to also clip in a really weird way, if you know what I'm talking about."
4746060,4748300," So, but that was actually..."
4748300,4758540," Why is it clipping like that? You know what I'm talking about? It's just like so weird."
4760540,4769500," So, it's really strange. It's not really clipping, but it's like, yeah, clicking rather."
4769500,4774940," It's rather clicking. So, what if I remove"
4774940,4780220," this entire thing? The two split stuff."
4783260,4796700," The two splits and..."
4796700,4798700," Mm-hmm."
4798700,4802700," Mm-hmm."
4802700,4804700," Mm-hmm."
4804700,4806700," Mm-hmm."
4806700,4820220," Where was I?"
4820220,4823100," Where was I?"
4823100,4831020," I wanted to just do the single bounce, right? So,"
4831020,4834380," basically without multiplying stuff like that, right?"
4834380,4837260," So, when we have to split, right?"
4837260,4839900," So, this is basically what I needed to do, all of that stuff, right?"
4839900,4845660," This is basically where I wanted to do this kind of stuff."
4845660,4848780," So, this is going to be a single beep."
4850940,4856860," Ah, so, let's actually don't do the right one, because I think the right one goes in the opposite"
4856860,4860940," direction. So, yeah, what we can do in here, we can just forget about the right one."
4860940,4863340," So, okay. So, that actually makes it super convenient."
4863340,4870700," So, now you can just play it with a single note, right? And that should be fine."
4873180,4887180," Mm-hmm."
4887180,4897340," Okay. So, the problem here is that they still click on overlapping."
4897340,4902220," That's what's interesting. So, they still click on overlapping, and I'm not really sure why."
4902780,4909500," That is very interesting. So, and is this because of this division here?"
4909500,4924780," I don't really think so. So, let me see. So, if I remove this division..."
4932780,4943900," No. Okay. So, this is not because of this division."
4943900,4950780," Um, all right. That is very interesting. So, why would that happen when they overlap?"
4953020,4958300," Why would that happen? So, they will probably amplify in some sense."
4960620,4967420," There's no reason for them to be this way, you know what I'm talking about."
4967420,4975900," Where is the bug coming from? I clearly don't see it."
4977100,4981740," I really, really don't see it. It'll be nice to maybe visualize this kind of thing and just"
4981740,4990780," see how it looks like. But, yeah. Yeah, it will be kind of cool. So, maybe we could"
4990780,5001580," basically play two beeps after a certain amount of time, then try to hear that in a separate sample,"
5002140,5007100," and then visualize that sample and see how it goes. But that will take a lot of time to code."
5007100,5012780," Something like this will take a lot of time to code. So, I don't really want to spend too much time on that."
5014060,5020140," All right. So, another thing we can do, we can just try to look at the code and find the problem in the code."
5020140,5024380," So, duration."
5024380,5032540," Duration."
5032540,5037100," So, it's going to be a fader."
5044060,5052540," So, then we divide that entire thing."
5052540,5064860," Maybe it makes sense to actually maintain some sort of a counter in here, right, where we basically"
5066620,5072140," don't divide it by length, but rather by this counter, because it may not necessarily be..."
5072140,5075900," Okay. And because of that, I can move, retain outside of this entire thing."
5075900,5078620," Okay. So, that's a little bit better."
5078620,5084380," But I know for a fact that this is not because of the division, right?"
5084380,5087580," So, I don't know. But, I mean, it's just like a nice thing to have anyway."
5087580,5089900," It's a nice thing to have anyway."
5090540,5096540," All right. So, this has to be mutable, of course. Yeah. The rest has to be annoying like that, of course."
5096540,5103100," Because that will make my code safer, obviously."
5118060,5119180," We need to implement..."
5119180,5141740," We need to implement a real-time renderer for sure."
5148860,5154620," Okay. So, maybe I'm going to just try to output two things in there."
5154620,5161420," But to be able to output two things, I think I want to have an access to the beeper."
5161420,5168860," Right. So, but I mean, I can just create the beeper outside of the entire stuff. So, I just can make it"
5170460,5173660," public. Right. So, let's make the beeper public."
5173660,5178540," Then, this thing will become public. And the update as well."
5178540,5181740," Man, I feel like I'm going into like a very deep rabbit hole."
5181740,5183820," And I don't really have that much time left."
5183820,5187340," Okay. So, maybe I'm not going to go into this rabbit hole."
5187340,5189980," Right. Because, yeah, we're already running out of time."
5189980,5192060," So, it's really dangerous for me to go there."
5192060,5195020," Because I'm probably not going to end up anywhere."
5195020,5198380," And I'm going to be really frustrated. So, I don't really want to frustrate myself too much."
5198380,5203340," Right. So, because I already have enough, you know, reasons to be frustrating these days."
5203340,5205740," So, let's leave it as this."
5205740,5212700," And the final result of today's session is going to be that we managed to do something cool."
5212700,5214060," Right. Look, look, look, look."
5214060,5215580," So, let's see."
5215580,5218780," So, this is going to be the right area."
5218780,5221420," And this one is going to be this one."
5221420,5228620," Right. So, maybe the next day, I'm going to like look at this code with a fresh head."
5228620,5231020," And see what's the problem."
5231020,5233420," And maybe have a motivation to actually do the proper debugging."
5233420,5235340," Because right now, I'm going to frustrate myself."
5235340,5237580," Yeah."
5240700,5251260," So, let's take a look at the final results."
5251260,5254380," Oh, shit."
5254380,5257740," It's in such a..."
5257740,5258860," Okay."
5258860,5267580," Not bad. Pretty cool."
5268220,5269340," So, what's interesting..."
5269340,5269900," Okay. So..."
5269900,5274860," I cannot let it go."
5274860,5278540," Let's stash everything."
5278540,5279740," Just for a second."
5279740,5280140," Last thing."
5280140,5281500," I want to check last thing."
5281500,5282940," Was the bug always there?"
5282940,5284940," Was the bug always there?"
5284940,5292060," So, I'm basically stashing the latest changes."
5292060,5294780," And let's just see if the bug was always there."
5295740,5296620," Because maybe it was."
5296620,5297020," I don't know."
5297020,5301500," And maybe in fact, I didn't really fix anything when there were consequence things."
5301500,5313500," So, I did introduce."
5313500,5315580," So, the bug was introduced in here."
5315580,5316700," Right."
5316700,5318700," So, maybe this is what we can look for now."
5320060,5323260," Henry Covey, thank you so much for 18 months of tier one subscription."
5323260,5329020," So, but I didn't really do anything significant in here."
5329020,5333340," So, I didn't change much in the mixing itself."
5333340,5334540," If you know what I'm talking about."
5336780,5339500," There's nothing much in the mixing per se."
5339500,5345740," One of the things we can try."
5345740,5348940," Is instead of dividing."
5348940,5351580," I don't know why I'm going there."
5351580,5353180," Like, I should basically stop."
5353180,5354780," But it's really fucking difficult."
5354780,5355580," So..."
5355580,5358220," Okay."
5358220,5360220," So, what if we don't divide this thing."
5360220,5363100," But at least we can clamp this entire stuff."
5363100,5363420," Right."
5363420,5365500," Maybe that's what's going on."
5365500,5366700," Clamp it between one."
5366700,5369580," Is that basically..."
5369580,5370460," Yeah."
5370460,5370700," I don't know."
5370700,5371500," Maybe it's clipping."
5371500,5372460," Maybe that's what it is."
5372460,5373660," It cannot be..."
5373660,5374940," Okay."
5374940,5376060," So, you cannot dereference."
5376060,5376460," Whatever."
5381900,5382460," Mhm."
5382460,5404300," A real-time renderer on the next stream for sure."
5404300,5410460," Yeah."
5410460,5411100," It was clipping."
5411900,5414780," Basically, it was clipping."
5414780,5419340," So, division didn't really help with this kind of stuff."
5419340,5421500," So, it is what it is."
5421500,5425020," So, yeah."
5425020,5427820," That's pretty cool."
5427820,5428860," So, we kind of fixed it."
5428860,5431580," To some extent."
5431580,5432060," Right."
5432060,5433020," To some extent."
5433020,5435340," So, let's actually try to make it like that."
5435340,5439420," And maybe I'm gonna make..."
5440060,5443180," Man, I really wish I could just compute it at compile time."
5443180,5443820," But no."
5443820,5445820," Having floating points."
5445820,5449100," Consistent floating points on all of the platforms is so hard."
5449100,5450700," That you have to suffer."
5450700,5451260," Right."
5451260,5454140," So, there is literally no solution to that problem whatsoever."
5454140,5456140," To make the life of the developer comfortable."
5456140,5457420," So, you just have to suffer."
5457420,5458380," Right."
5458380,5460380," So, it's just like impossible problem to solve."
5461980,5462620," Okay."
5462620,5467500," So, to the power of like 10 to 2."
5467500,5469180," So, I mean..."
5469180,5470620," Like, okay."
5470620,5473020," It is inconsistent on all the platforms."
5473020,5477340," But is there any way to the compiler to say I don't give a shit?"
5478380,5481260," Because I'm not shipping that to all of the platforms."
5481260,5485740," I'm just writing the code that I want to work on my machine right here, right now."
5485740,5487260," And I don't care."
5487260,5488540," Sure."
5488540,5489740," I do understand."
5489740,5490140," It is..."
5490140,5491740," Complicated."
5491740,5493580," But what if I don't care?"
5493580,5495580," Right."
5495580,5495820," So..."
5495820,5501660," What if I don't fucking care for this specific like time?"
5502300,5503740," Just let me do that."
5503740,5505180," Okay."
5505180,5505420," So..."
5505420,5507660," Fucking no man."
5507660,5509980," Nine."
5509980,5512540," So..."
5512540,5514540," And this is going to be something like this."
5514540,5517180," Right."
5532300,5533100," I don't know."
5533100,5547660," Because it's a throwaway software anyway."
5547660,5558140," So..."
5558140,5560140," What I'm trying to do right now is just like..."
5560140,5561660," Maybe..."
5561660,5563020," Get it..."
5563020,5565420," Uh-huh."
5565420,5567980," 1853."
5567980,5570620," Uh..."
5570620,5573180," To something that is presentable if you know what I'm talking about."
5573180,5573420," Right."
5573420,5576380," Um..."
5588140,5598700," Maybe I also want to reduce like the master sound."
5598700,5604540," Yeah."
5604540,5606300," So that's pretty cool."
5606300,5610700," So one of the things we can do here as well when we're playing..."
5610700,5613340," Where's the clamp?"
5615260,5615500," Yeah."
5615500,5617660," Also multiply that by beep volume just in case."
5617660,5620060," Right."
5620060,5622460," And let's see if it's going to be too bad."
5622460,5637580," So I think this is a pretty extensive test of a video format."
5637580,5641260," Well, I mean, it's not really like..."
5641260,5643020," The sound is not part of the video format."
5643020,5643500," So..."
5643500,5666300," And what if we try to change the step with which we actually incrementing things when we're splitting the rectangles."
5667020,5668620," So the step right now is 4."
5668620,5669740," Um..."
5669740,5671820," 1..."
5671820,5672220," 1..."
5672220,5673260," 2..."
5673260,5673740," 3..."
5673740,5674140," 4..."
5674140,5675020," Um..."
5675020,5680220," So what about 3?"
5680220,5681340," 1..."
5681340,5681580," 2..."
5681580,5681900," 3..."
5681900,5684380," So it's going to be a little bit like a minor thingy."
5684380,5686220," But I think it might work."
5686220,5687420," Right."
5687420,5688300," So..."
5688300,5689340," And let's just listen to that."
5689340,5694620," Let's just listen to that."
5703580,5716620," Okay, I don't know why I'm taking off my headphones."
5716620,5726220," Okay."
5727500,5728620," So I guess that's fine."
5728620,5738220," So, how does it sound, by the way?"
5738220,5739580," Does it sound alright?"
5750060,5750620," It's not bad."
5750620,5752860," It's still a bit loud."
5752860,5760220," Alright."
5760220,5762540," So, let's do a committee committee."
5762540,5765020," And maybe later we can come up with something more interesting."
5765020,5768140," Sound spoke to me."
5768140,5769580," But I reduced the sound."
5769580,5771180," So, yeah."
5771180,5774220," Let's actually post that on the Discord server."
5774220,5775420," So..."
5775420,5778940," Oh my god."
5778940,5779740," It's so slow."
5779740,5783820," Upload the file."
5783820,5790460," Careful."
5790460,5792380," Potential."
5792380,5796380," Potential loud sound."
5796380,5796780," Mega."
5798540,5798860," Okay."
5798860,5806220," So, yeah."
5806220,5806780," Looks alright."
5806780,5814620," Is not multiplying clamped value."
5814620,5818300," Clamp."
5827340,5827900," Well, yeah."
5827900,5829660," It is not actually."
5829660,5831900," Thank you."
5831900,5837260," So, let's listen to this thing now."
5837260,5845820," Yeah, I'm already tired."
5845820,5847580," I'm starting to make these kind of mistakes."
5847580,5872300," That wasn't helpful."
5872300,5873900," So, let's not do that."
5873900,5878380," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5878380,5879180," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5879180,5880380," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5880380,5881580," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5881580,5882380," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5882380,5882700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5882700,5883580," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5883580,5884060," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5884060,5884860," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5884860,5885580," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5885580,5886380," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5886380,5887180," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5887180,5887820," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5887820,5888780," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5888780,5889740," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5889740,5890380," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5890380,5891180," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5891180,5892060," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5892060,5896700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5896700,5898700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5898700,5900700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5900700,5902700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5902700,5904700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5904700,5906700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5906700,5908700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5908700,5910700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5910700,5912780," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5912780,5914780," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5914780,5915980," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5915980,5917980," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5917980,5918700," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5918700,5919980," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5919980,5920780," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5920780,5921980," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5921980,5922780," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5922780,5923980," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5923980,5924860," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5924860,5925980," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5925980,5926860," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5926860,5928860," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5928860,5930860," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5930860,5932860," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5932860,5934860," I'm going to make these kind of mistakes."
5934860,5935660," kind of interesting to do."
5935660,5938300," But I'm not sure if I want to do it like in the near future."
5938300,5939580," But there's something to keep in mind."
5939580,5942940," So let me let me try."
5942940,5954140," Implement sound generation for the complex version."
5954140,5955420," And there we go."
5955420,5956620," We're going to push that into the repo."
5956620,5957340," All right."
5957340,5960220," So today was a relatively productive stream."
5960220,5963100," So I think I'm done with the sound system in here."
5963980,5969740," We can try to do different sort of like schemes of sound generations."
5969740,5969980," Right."
5969980,5975980," So maybe step differently or maybe do the beeps on different kind of events."
5975980,5979740," But I think I exhausted the potential this entire thing."
5979740,5981580," And I kind of want to move on to something else."
5981580,5987500," So and the thing I want to move on to is real-time rendering."
5987500,5992780," Because it's kind of lame to wait so long to just see the result."
5992780,5996620," It would be way nicer if it was like a real-time renderer thingy."
5996620,5999980," So we're already going outside of the scope of this project completely."
5999980,6008780," So and maybe because of that I'm going to create a new project with the same simulator module."
6008780,6011660," But with the like OpenGL renderer and whatnot."
6011660,6018140," And maybe also with the integration with the ALSA or Pulse Audio or something like that."
