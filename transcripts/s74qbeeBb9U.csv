667000,668000," And we trust it."
668000,677000," And we trust it."
677000,697500," I haven't been following along. So yeah, essentially this is my new look from now on and that's the explanation. Hello Linux 9.2 numbers and Harp Joshi. Hello, hello. Hello, welcome, welcome, welcome."
697500,716260," So, today is Friday, as I already mentioned, and that means today on your schedule we are doing a random one-off stream. And the topic of today's stream is spam filter in Haskell. So yeah, that topic was inspired by Erica M on Discord and here she's stripped back. Thank you, thank you very much."
716260,737200," She was implementing like a spam filter for Discord using Naive Bay's classifier. And since my university was such a shit, I never learned about such techniques. So I decided to make up for that on my streams and learn about that on the Friday stream."
737200,755680," So yeah, thank you. Thank you so much for inspiring today's topic. I didn't read much about that technique. So I just read like a very, very concise Wikipedia article. And I don't want to read anything else on that. I want to just try to derive the solution off of that Wikipedia article."
755920,777040," So don't expect anything particularly educational out of that stream, because I'm going to pull off this solution for this classifier out of my ass, literally. Not literally, I mean, it's against us, but just keep in mind that I have no idea what I'm doing, right? But I kind of get the whole, like, the general idea of how to do all of that."
777040,790840," So, and that's essentially how we're going to go today. All right. So, already triggered. I'm sorry, Lost Algorithm. I know that you're doing that, like, professionally."
790840,799840," But yeah, I'm probably going to do, going to make a lot of mistakes. And please, please forgive me for that. By the way, hello, Lost Algorithm. Welcome, welcome, welcome."
800640,817420," So, let's get started. So, what is Naive Base Classifier? So, there's, like, a whole Wikipedia article on that, apparently. So, Naive Base Classifier Spam Filter. Like, there's literally a Wikipedia article dedicated to that."
819020,833300," Yeah. So, there's a separate article about Naive Base Classifier and specifically application for spam filtering. And it doesn't really explain much, except this formula."
833300,840300," I think this formula is the most important part of this article. And this is essentially what we need to implement."
841300,844940," All right. So, has anyone, has anybody heard about"
844940,847000," Bayes' theorem?"
847000,855640," Even though my university was a, was shit, I still know what it is, because we had a course on probability theory."
855640,860360," So, of course, we learned that formula, because this formula is very important for probability theory."
860360,866780," And, yeah, it looks like this. I mean, we can take a look at the proper rendering of that formula. Yeah."
867360,873340," So, essentially, what that means, like, what is this notation, right? So, we have this notation, B stands for probability."
873340,880940," And what is that? So, A and B are different events, right? So, what this entire thing means."
880940,887800," So, this is a probability of event A happening, given that event B has happened."
887800,896080," Or, in other words, A being true, given that B is already true, right? And this is the formula, if I understand correctly."
897020,907880," So, essentially, it's equal to probability of B being true, given that A is already true, multiplied by probability of A, divided by probability of B."
907880,915280," So, and that's the whole formula, actually, that is used in the naive Bayes' spam filter."
915740,927220," So, and this is how they do that, right? So, on the left, excuse me, on the left here, they have a class, right?"
927220,929900," Since it's a classifier. What is a classifier, by the way, right?"
930240,940200," So, essentially, you have a fixed amount of classes, right? And class could be like a topic or a theme of the text, right?"
940540,947440," So, in case of a spam filters, you have only two classes, spam and not spam."
947440,952200," By the way, while researching this topic on, before the stream, I did a little bit of research."
952200,955760," I didn't implement anything, but I just skimmed through the articles."
956140,961080," Apparently, in the industry, the opposite of spam is called ham."
961780,963940," And that made me laugh so fucking hard."
963940,965160," Like, I didn't know that."
965160,967800," It's so fucking funny, right?"
967800,971780," So, yeah, something that is not spam is a ham."
971780,974600," God fucking dumb."
974600,978060," And, by the way, this is why they have a probability of H."
978060,983720," It's a probability of the message being ham, and S is a probability of the message being spam."
983720,985780," Jesus Christ, this is so funny."
985780,986860," Like, I didn't know that."
986860,988860," It's just..."
988860,991960," That's really clever."
991960,999660," Anyway, so, in case of a spam classifier, you have only two classes, spam and ham, right?"
999660,1008980," So, but I think you can generalize that even to more classes, and we'll get to that a little bit later once we implement, like, a spam classifier."
1008980,1013060," Because I want to implement something like that for our bot, right?"
1013060,1020560," Maybe it will have a capability of classifying messages, like a web message, or backseating message, or so on and so forth."
1020560,1024420," We can have, like, a different common classes for the messages in the chat."
1024420,1032480," And maybe we can assign a particular actions on encountering a particular class of message, right?"
1032480,1037900," So, banable, I mean, we're not going to ban web messages, but maybe do something interesting with that."
1037900,1040680," So, you can expand that idea even further."
1040680,1045160," So, and how that works."
1045160,1045740," All right."
1048560,1053260," So, on the left here, S is a class, right?"
1053260,1059060," S is a class, and W is a word that is present in the message."
1059060,1064280," So, usually, these kind of classifiers, they use a model called bag of words."
1064280,1066020," Have you guys heard about bag of words?"
1066020,1066800," Yeah, here it is."
1066800,1067980," So, here's a bag of words."
1068220,1079380," It's actually a very dumb model, but essentially, you take a sentence and just build a histogram of it, right?"
1079380,1082080," So, essentially, you build, like, a multi-set."
1082080,1086760," Like, for each word, you just associate amount of words in that sentence."
1086760,1094200," And given this table, you can easily calculate the probability of that word being in that sentence,"
1094200,1100100," because it's basically the amount of the source divided by the amount of the whole words in the sentence, right?"
1100100,1103160," Bag of words."
1103160,1105380," Is my pronunciation that bad?"
1105380,1107720," Words."
1107720,1109840," Anyway."
1109840,1111740," I don't speak English anyway."
1111740,1113300," This is trying."
1113300,1117460," So, yeah."
1117460,1119420," So, and."
1119420,1124040," So, probability of the whole message."
1124200,1130120," being a spam, given that it contains the word W, right?"
1130120,1135760," So, we have a message, and probability of being a spam, if it contains this particular word."
1135760,1137080," What is it equal to?"
1137080,1138100," What is it equal to?"
1138100,1148700," It is equal to probability of that word being in the message, if it is a spam."
1148700,1151340," So, it's kind of, it's opposite of this one."
1151340,1152840," It's actually quite important."
1153720,1155840," But this, this is opposite of this one."
1155840,1160120," So, probability of the message being spam, if the word is there, in there."
1160120,1165400," And this is probability of having that word in the message, if it is already spam."
1165400,1168220," So, we're assuming here that it is already spam."
1168220,1171020," And what's the probability of that word being there?"
1171020,1172380," Right."
1173260,1179220," So, the next one is the probability of, like, the whole probability of this message being a spam."
1179960,1181200," So, what does that mean?"
1181200,1184680," So, this thing can be hard-coded."
1184680,1188460," This entire thing can be actually hard-coded, and they even talk about that here."
1188460,1190800," So, basically, it's like a general statistics."
1190800,1196620," So, generally, we know that 80% of the messages are spam, and 20% of the messages are ham."
1196620,1202040," So, you can basically treat PRS and PRH as the constants."
1202040,1205700," So, this is like a, you know, general thing."
1205700,1208880," And that makes the formula look a little bit complicated."
1208880,1213800," But what's funny is that there is a classifier called unbiased classifier,"
1213920,1219460," where they essentially assign 50% to the probability of S and probability of H,"
1219460,1221540," which simplifies the formula dramatically."
1221540,1226620," So, yeah, you can basically remove these two constants, and this is the whole formula."
1226620,1227480," Right."
1227480,1229640," So, and we're going to work with that."
1229640,1230100," Right."
1230100,1233180," So, we have a probability of a word being printed on the message,"
1233180,1235160," if we know that it's already spam,"
1235160,1237620," divided by the same value."
1237620,1240040," As you can see, it's the same value."
1240420,1246040," Plus, the probability of a word being in a message, if it is ham."
1246040,1248500," And that's it."
1248500,1250180," That's the whole formula."
1250180,1253400," That's the whole formula."
1253400,1256260," So, and what's interesting is that this is not enough."
1256260,1258100," This is only for a single word."
1258100,1258520," Right."
1258520,1260260," This is only for a single word."
1260260,1263540," But messages contain several words."
1263540,1265600," So, you have to calculate multiple probabilities."
1265600,1271020," And after you calculate it, after you know how to calculate probability for a single word,"
1271020,1274700," what you do is you compose these probabilities."
1274700,1275320," Right."
1275320,1282540," So, essentially, the whole probability of this message being a spam is this."
1282540,1287220," So, it's multiplication of P1 to Pn and this thing."
1287300,1295120," And P1 is basically probability of the first word, P2 is probability of the second word, and so on and so forth."
1295120,1296960," So, you basically substitute to that formula."
1296960,1299200," And, yeah."
1299200,1306420," But I'm not quite sure if I simply iterate through all of the words of the message"
1306420,1309420," or through all of the known words."
1309420,1311080," That's the question."
1311080,1314220," So, I'm not even sure."
1314220,1317440," But I don't think it matters that much."
1317440,1321820," Because it does not stop us from implementing this entire thing."
1321820,1323100," So, okay."
1323100,1327100," The question is, how can we know these values?"
1327100,1331480," How can I know the probability of a word being in a message if it is spam"
1331480,1334180," and the probability of the word being in a message if it's ham?"
1334180,1336200," Well, it's quite simple."
1336200,1339220," We just need to maintain, if I understand correctly, again."
1339220,1342620," I just skimmed through the articles and I didn't read into them."
1342620,1346720," You basically keep track of two bags of words."
1346720,1351280," Bags of words for spam and bags of words for ham."
1351280,1352220," Right."
1352220,1358380," And with these bags of words, you can easily just calculate these two probabilities."
1358380,1359460," Right."
1359460,1362960," Because you have statistics and from statistics you derive the probabilities."
1362960,1366920," You just put that into a formula and you get the probability of a single word."
1366920,1369940," And then you go through all of the words and you multiply the probabilities"
1369940,1372520," and you get the probability of this message being a spam."
1372520,1375800," So, it's just basically calculating a huge formula."
1375800,1376540," Okay."
1376540,1379320," Professional machine learning engineers."
1379980,1381720," Did I understand this thing correctly?"
1381720,1383500," I'm just..."
1383500,1385520," I just read only a single Wikipedia article."
1385520,1389280," Is the stream there?"
1389280,1391080," Or everyone is just listening to me?"
1391080,1391500," Okay."
1391500,1394560," Wikipedia..."
1394560,1396080," Wikipedia, by the way, yes."
1396080,1397000," I'm..."
1397000,1399920," Testing, testing."
1400040,1401600," Hello to a reclamer."
1401600,1401860," Local."
1401860,1403360," So, yeah."
1403360,1404420," It..."
1404420,1407760," To be fair, it doesn't really matter if I got it right or wrong."
1407760,1410700," Because it doesn't stop me from implementing it."
1410700,1412320," So, I'm going to implement it."
1412320,1414280," Sedation."
1414280,1414760," Okay."
1414760,1419080," I'm going to just implement it how I understand it."
1419080,1422260," And we'll see if it works or not."
1422260,1425260," We'll just apply whatever I derived from this article."
1425720,1429140," And maybe the mistakes I've made would be obvious."
1429140,1429440," Right."
1429440,1431160," Maybe it's going to be completely wrong."
1431160,1432160," Sounded fine."
1432160,1432400," Yep."
1432400,1435400," You keep track of vocabulary words in your training data."
1435400,1439140," Unseen words don't matter until you add it to a set of training data."
1439140,1441220," Okay."
1441220,1443480," So, the only thing I don't understand."
1443480,1445060," The only thing I don't understand."
1445060,1446480," N."
1446480,1449360," We're iterating through N of the words."
1449360,1451420," What are these words?"
1451420,1455440," Are the words of the message that we're currently classifying?"
1455720,1460220," Or are they words of all of the messages that we know about?"
1460220,1462680," All of the words we know about?"
1462680,1465440," So, what we are iterating?"
1465440,1470700," Words of the message or the words of everything that we've seen so far?"
1473260,1479640," I think it was your TF-IDF implementation in Haskell that works well with NaiveBase."
1479640,1482460," At least a bit nicer than pure words indicator."
1482460,1483180," Oh, yeah."
1483180,1483760," By the way, yeah."
1483760,1486360," I implemented TF-IDF and it was also in Haskell."
1486580,1489460," But I'm not going to expand it, I think."
1489460,1493060," Yeah."
1493060,1497860," And the TF-IDF kind of has like a different purpose, right?"
1497860,1501200," So, it was purely for searching things."
1501200,1503820," Is probability of message being a spam?"
1503960,1506280," I guess P1 is the first word of the sentence."
1506280,1510060," How does it feel to go bold?"
1510060,1512420," It actually feels quite nice, to be fair."
1512420,1514000," I kind of like it."
1514000,1516040," All right."
1516040,1518080," So, let's get started."
1518080,1519060," Let's get started."
1519060,1520720," All right."
1520800,1523140," So, I was thinking, how should we call the project?"
1523140,1526220," How should we call the project?"
1526220,1534240," So, the most obvious and delusionally clever name would be to call it Hammer."
1534240,1543740," But after googling this name, I realized that I'm not the only one who's that clever."
1543740,1549060," Because people already done literally that, apparently."
1549340,1554100," Like, there's literally a spam filter using base analysis that is called Hammer."
1554100,1556640," So, okay."
1556640,1559600," So, then I was thinking, how can I call it?"
1559600,1559820," Okay."
1559820,1560400," So, Ham."
1560400,1566720," Can I just take a word Ham and translate it to Russian, right?"
1566720,1573220," So, in Russian, Ham is spelled like this."
1573220,1578220," And the problem is that if you translate that to Cyrillic, it looks very..."
1579020,1580000," Strange."
1580000,1582640," It looks very controversial."
1582640,1585860," I'm not sure if I'm going to call it like that."
1585860,1587380," So, yeah."
1587380,1589520," This is how we call Ham in Russian, by the way."
1589520,1590440," We call it Vet China."
1590440,1592380," But it's not pronounced like that."
1592380,1593420," It's pronounced with Chinat."
1593420,1594160," But..."
1594160,1597040," All right."
1597040,1599340," So, maybe I'm not going to call it like that."
1599340,1600280," But to be fair."
1600280,1605840," That would be such a cool name for a spam filter, if you think about it."
1605840,1612800," That's really interesting."
1612800,1613060," Okay."
1613060,1616000," But yeah, we'll..."
1616000,1619660," Wet China."
1622620,1623600," Sounds a little bit better."
1623600,1623920," Okay."
1623920,1627320," So, maybe we're going to call it Vet China."
1627320,1639100," To be fair, we can just use the Cyrillic look-alike transliteration."
1639600,1641120," I'm spaining too much."
1641120,1643520," Huh."
1643520,1649440," So, that means we can use..."
1649440,1651200," Oh, goddammit."
1651200,1655380," No."
1655380,1655900," Whatever."
1657100,1661220," So, let's go with something else."
1661220,1667640," Although, Vet is not going to..."
1667640,1669920," Yes."
1669920,1671560," Bike shading."
1671560,1671820," Yeah."
1671820,1673040," This is literally bike shading."
1673040,1674980," Hello, Sokram."
1674980,1675600," Lit."
1675600,1676580," Welcome to the stream."
1676580,1680080," So, yeah."
1680080,1683500," I'm going to call it Vet China."
1683500,1685100," I think it's going to be..."
1685100,1686060," I think it's going to be..."
1686060,1687860," At any point, I can just say it's Russian."
1687860,1688800," It's literally Russian."
1688800,1689640," Look."
1689640,1691340," Yeah."
1691340,1696100," All right."
1696100,1699120," So, we're going to do that in Haskell, by the way."
1699120,1700080," I forgot to mention that."
1700080,1701220," We're going to do that in Haskell."
1701220,1704760," We're going to do that in Haskell."
1704760,1709620," So, I think I will need some third-party dependencies."
1709620,1714520," I think I will need some third-party dependencies, specifically like text."
1716060,1726520," Maybe I'm also going to maintain the database, because I need to store all of that in some sort of a database, and it would be nice to have something like SQLite or whatever."
1728400,1738140," Because of that, I think I'm going to do that in Haskell, because of that, I think I'm going to go and start a cabal project."
1738140,1741560," Yeah, but PTTB..."
1741560,1742360," Okay."
1742360,1742900," Cabal."
1742900,1743940," New."
1743940,1745180," I think this is how we do that."
1745180,1749600," I forgot how to create a new project in..."
1749600,1750940," Is it version..."
1750940,1752440," Uh-huh."
1752440,1754620," Version 2 new?"
1754620,1756780," Uh-huh."
1756780,1759840," There is just new build, new style projects."
1759840,1761240," Maybe it's just init."
1761240,1764080," Compile."
1764080,1765720," Oh, new it's..."
1765720,1766340," Okay, I see."
1766340,1767420," Is it just init?"
1767420,1768880," I don't quite remember."
1768880,1769700," I think it's just init."
1769700,1770720," Let's try init."
1774720,1775480," Precisely, cabal."
1775480,1776380," You need interactive."
1776380,1777340," Eh."
1777340,1780100," To be fair, I don't really want it to be interactive."
1780100,1784300," Because I don't want to go through their quiz and stuff like that."
1784300,1785360," All right."
1785360,1788560," So, this is going to be the chunam."
1788560,1793720," And what are the dependencies that we'll need?"
1793720,1798060," So far, I think, the only dependency I definitely will need is text."
1802060,1804760," What's up for fucking tonight?"
1804760,1805600," Welcome to the stream."
1805600,1808200," What's up, what's up?"
1808200,1810600," And, uh..."
1810600,1814020," Yeah, we're going to add this one."
1814020,1815280," Maybe I'm going to just..."
1815280,1818280," Um..."
1818280,1820420," Yeah, why am I using Veeam?"
1820420,1821100," I don't understand."
1821100,1824560," Oh, my God."
1824560,1828180," So, this is going to be text."
1828180,1831140," But I'm not sure which text I want to use here."
1831340,1835000," Which text do I have already in my GHC package?"
1835000,1836600," So, let's actually do list."
1836600,1842740," And one of the text that I have, it's down there."
1842740,1844500," It has to be down there."
1844500,1847660," Wait a second."
1847660,1848920," Okay, here it is."
1848920,1850540," So, this is the text that we have."
1855180,1856380," So, it's..."
1856380,1864220," So, it has to be greater or equal than that."
1864220,1867440," And less than that."
1867440,1869380," Okay."
1869380,1870960," So, that should be enough."
1870960,1875780," And I'm going to try to build the whole thing with Cabal."
1876120,1877940," I don't know why it took me so much."
1877940,1881120," Because, probably, I haven't worked with Cabal for quite some time."
1881120,1886420," Hmm..."
1886420,1888380," I'm through the average in the same letters."
1888380,1889960," Well..."
1889960,1890600," I don't know."
1890600,1895360," So, maybe we don't really use that word as frequently as English speakers."
1895860,1901280," Because the more frequent words usually are shorter."
1901280,1905860," So, people usually, like, naturally apply the..."
1905860,1908080," I forgot the name."
1911760,1912280," Okay."
1912280,1913580," I'm thinking about solution."
1913580,1915580," That's why I cannot..."
1915580,1916220," I cannot think."
1916220,1916860," All right."
1916860,1919920," So, let's try to implement a bag of words."
1919920,1924060," What's the difference between version 2 and version 3?"
1924060,1925060," Is there a version 3?"
1925060,1927100," I don't think there's a version 3."
1927100,1928800," All right."
1928800,1930880," So, we're going to introduce a type, maybe."
1930880,1934640," So, we'll need data..."
1934640,1936960," Data map."
1941760,1946360," To be fair, I think I should be able to do something like this."
1946360,1947360," Halfman."
1947360,1947660," Yes."
1947660,1948660," I forgot the half..."
1948660,1948820," Yeah."
1948820,1949120," Thank you."
1949120,1949680," Thank you so much."
1949680,1950100," Oh, my God."
1950100,1954000," I completely forgot about the halfman."
1954000,1956540," So, we don't have containers, right?"
1956540,1957400," We don't have containers."
1957400,1963160," So, I'll have to find what containers can we use."
1963160,1965800," Containers."
1965800,1967240," Yeah."
1967240,1968360," Here they are."
1968360,1970780," And we'll have to add them to the build as well."
1971440,1972460," So, it's going to be Cabal."
1972460,1977540," Okay."
1977540,1979020," And this is going to be that."
1979020,1982000," Less than 7."
1982000,1984320," And there we go."
1984320,1985900," Can I just go to repo now?"
1985900,1988920," So, essentially, we're going to just use a map."
1988920,1994800," Just a regular map to build all of that."
1994800,1998500," To build the bag of words."
1999020,2002400," So, let's imagine that we have some text."
2002400,2005460," Let's have some text."
2005460,2013720," So, something like this should be okay."
2013720,2016260," I might as well just paste it here."
2016260,2019160," And maybe even assign all of that to some sort of a variable."
2019160,2019660," There we go."
2019660,2025900," So, at any point, we should be able to split that into words, right?"
2025960,2027100," So, here are the words."
2027100,2031640," And now, we need to collect that into a bag of words."
2031640,2035900," So, the easiest thing to do here would be to fold left, right?"
2035900,2038500," Where we have an accumulator and a word."
2039000,2042160," And then, we'll have to add that word to that accumulator."
2042160,2048640," And the initial thing is going to be an empty map, right?"
2048640,2049760," It's going to be an empty map."
2049760,2054520," But we'll have to import data map as M."
2054880,2058920," So, an empty map is usually created like this, right?"
2058920,2062340," So, the module map has an empty map that you can use."
2062340,2066840," And the empty map is the initial state of our folding, right?"
2066840,2070780," And the question is, how can we fold them together, right?"
2070780,2071960," How can we fold them together?"
2071960,2075940," Well, it depends on what kind of operations we have for the maps."
2078720,2087940," So, how do you insert something?"
2087940,2092180," So, you can insert a particular thing."
2092180,2095820," So, there's this one."
2095820,2099960," Insert with."
2099960,2106320," I have an interesting idea, I think."
2107500,2109680," I have an interesting idea."
2109680,2114780," What if we do a very similar thing as we did with Markov?"
2114780,2122520," So, we're going to define our own type."
2122520,2125280," New type, bag of words."
2125280,2127360," And maybe we're going to call it something like this."
2127360,2129080," As map."
2129080,2131180," And, of course, it has to be something like"
2131180,2133940," ball to map."
2133940,2135780," And it's going to be M map."
2136080,2139600," Starting from the text to the frequency."
2139600,2142180," And we're going to implement a monoid."
2142180,2147300," Monoid for this particular type."
2147300,2151740," And essentially, when you've mapend these two monoids,"
2151740,2156320," it will merge the statistics of this word."
2156320,2157960," So, it's going to be way more convenient."
2160100,2160720," All right."
2160720,2166660," So, this is exactly what we did with the Markov model for the bot as well."
2166660,2166920," Right."
2166920,2168440," Markov model was also a monoid."
2168440,2174580," And you can easily create like a very small, simple monoid out of a single pair of words."
2174580,2179080," And then you can fold all of the monoids into the whole table."
2179260,2181920," So, and we'll also need an operation."
2181920,2187880," Word to ball."
2187880,2190260," Which accepts a single word."
2190260,2192520," And returns you a bag of words."
2192520,2197020," So, basically, it creates a single, like a bag of words out of a single word."
2197260,2198740," So, it should be pretty straightforward."
2198740,2201880," Because, essentially, you take that word."
2201880,2205940," And you say that this word maps to one."
2205940,2209180," And you construct a map out of it."
2209180,2210060," So, there you go."
2210060,2211660," This is how easily you can do all of that."
2212100,2214580," And then, the question is how you can merge all of that."
2214580,2220880," Well, we have a special operations to merge two maps."
2220880,2221200," Right."
2221200,2222880," You have two maps and you can merge them."
2222880,2226040," You can even merge them with very specific operations."
2226040,2227440," Yeah."
2227440,2229900," So, let me try to implement all of that."
2229900,2232560," So, I'm going to use a half-scale mod."
2232560,2235520," Hopefully, it will tell me where I have errors and stuff like that."
2235520,2238420," And we will be able to quickly go through them."
2238420,2241520," So, by the way, this has to be like this."
2242100,2250480," So, I also need to import qualified data text as T."
2250480,2253240," And do we have anything else?"
2253240,2254900," Maybe I should just call it BOW."
2254900,2258400," Like, I shouldn't capitalize the last W."
2258400,2260820," Because, I mean, I keep typing it as small."
2260820,2263080," So, I'm going to do something like this."
2263080,2265580," Just simplify myself in life."
2265580,2266960," No advent of code."
2266960,2270640," I'm going to do advent of code if I have time."
2271420,2273060," After I implement all of that."
2273060,2274020," We'll see how it goes."
2274020,2275900," We'll see how it goes."
2275900,2276620," Okay."
2276620,2277440," M from list."
2277440,2279100," And what does it say?"
2279100,2280780," Oh, yeah."
2280780,2285140," After you constructed this thing, you have to wrap it into the bag of words."
2285140,2286080," And, okay."
2286080,2290820," So, before you can implement a monoid interface for bag of words, you have to implement a semi-group."
2290820,2292460," A semi-group for it."
2293100,2293440," All right."
2293440,2296460," And a semi-group accepts two bag of words."
2296460,2299020," This one and this one."
2299020,2302320," So, what's funny is that we can actually..."
2302320,2304460," What's interesting, not funny."
2304460,2308380," We can pattern match them and automatically unwrap them."
2308820,2320920," And here we can merge them together with M union with where we're going to say that you merge the values of these things."
2320920,2322740," Jay, the developer."
2322740,2323420," Thank you."
2323420,2325680," Thank you so much for three months of tier one subscription."
2325860,2326660," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
2326660,2329020," And welcome to our bag of words club."
2329020,2330200," That's right."
2330200,2333420," So, yeah."
2333420,2335320," That's what we're doing today."
2335320,2338660," We're trying to implement, like, a simple spam filter."
2338660,2340720," So, I'm going to just merge these two."
2340720,2342060," And I think that should be enough."
2342060,2345420," But after that, you'll have to wrap it back into bag of words."
2345420,2346540," There we go."
2346540,2348700," And I think..."
2348700,2354180," Yeah, we'll still need to implement the monoid because we need, like, an empty bag of words."
2355860,2357380," Makeover, nice."
2357380,2359100," What do you mean?"
2359100,2360440," You're talking about my hair?"
2360440,2362300," Yeah, I guess."
2362300,2364180," Do you like it?"
2364180,2366380," All right."
2366380,2369580," So, and we also need an empty bowl."
2369580,2370740," Right, an empty bowl."
2370740,2374580," And an empty bowl is essentially just, you know, empty map."
2374580,2380140," And then we need to implement a monoid for this thing."
2380140,2382540," Okay."
2383840,2392340," And to prove that it's a monoid, we have to say, we have to provide the empty, the neutral element of the monoid."
2392340,2393140," And there we go."
2393140,2394700," What's funny is that that's it."
2394700,2397060," That's the whole thing."
2397060,2399140," You know what we can do now?"
2399140,2402080," We can take the text."
2402080,2404640," Right."
2404640,2405400," This text."
2405400,2407700," I'm going to put it here."
2407700,2409840," Let us..."
2409840,2411040," It didn't work."
2412260,2412960," I don't know why."
2412960,2415920," I'm going to try it one more time."
2415920,2417920," Hopefully, it will work this time."
2417920,2420280," Is that because..."
2420280,2422160," Yeah, it's something with the new lines and stuff."
2422160,2422700," Okay, there we go."
2422700,2423520," So, I have a text."
2423520,2426020," So, then I can split it by words."
2426020,2427680," Right."
2427680,2429620," Zone out."
2429620,2430660," And this is new to me."
2430660,2432440," What does the semigroup type class do?"
2433900,2437100," It doesn't really do anything much."
2437100,2441720," It basically interface for types that are semigroups."
2441720,2443120," Oh, semigroups."
2443120,2444100," I don't know how to pronounce that."
2444100,2444880," What is a semigroup?"
2444880,2446500," Thank you, Embercode."
2446500,2449840," So, semigroup is an algebra."
2450300,2453020," So, it's a notion from abstract algebra."
2453020,2457300," It's essentially a system."
2457300,2459880," Sounds like Haskell, yeah, exactly."
2459880,2465940," It's essentially a system that consists of a set of elements."
2465940,2466560," Right."
2466560,2469700," In our case, like, usually it's numbers."
2470400,2473760," And a binary operation defined on that set."
2473760,2474820," Right."
2474820,2481340," So, for example, all of the integers and operation plus form a semigroup."
2481340,2482420," Right."
2482420,2490880," So, and, for example, all the integers and multiplication form a semigroup."
2490880,2499580," So, a monoid would be, for example, extension or maybe not extension, but a more specific semigroup"
2499580,2503300," that also has a neutral element like zero or like one."
2503300,2504120," Right."
2504120,2509020," So, essentially, bag of word is a semigroup."
2509020,2512140," Because we have a particular set of bag of words."
2512140,2519200," And we have an operation, binary operation, defined on that set of bag of words that allows us to merge them."
2519200,2519980," Right."
2519980,2523740," Because you can always, at any point, take two bag of words and just merge them together."
2523740,2526120," So, and that's essentially what we did."
2526180,2529900," We just explained to Haskell, okay, this thing is semigroup."
2529900,2534980," And now all of the, like, operations that work with semigroups will work on bag of words."
2534980,2538240," And I'm going to actually show how that works."
2538240,2539920," So, yeah."
2539920,2543040," And monoid is basically semigroup with a neutral element."
2543040,2549500," A neutral element is the one that is, when applied with a binary operation, doesn't change their original value."
2549740,2553040," For example, monoid integer plus zero."
2553040,2553580," Right."
2553580,2554940," Zero is a neutral element."
2554940,2560560," Because it doesn't matter to what value you apply the zero."
2560560,2562180," It's always going to be that value."
2562180,2565720," So, you see, it never changes that value."
2566200,2569720," Something like integer multiplication one is the same."
2569720,2570740," Right."
2570740,2572040," It never changes it."
2572040,2573400," All right."
2573400,2581880," So, and I also sort of explained to the Haskell system that bag of words is also monoid."
2581880,2587820," Because a neutral element for bag of words would be an empty bag of words that doesn't contain anything."
2588240,2588500," Okay."
2588500,2590800," So, why is that even needed?"
2590800,2592960," Why do we need to complicate it so much?"
2592960,2594480," And I am about to explain that."
2594480,2600040," So, let's split our sentence into words."
2600040,2603940," We don't have a variable not in the scope as."
2603940,2604180," Okay."
2604180,2607000," So, I'm going to take this thing one more time."
2607000,2610560," And I'm going to split this entire thing into words."
2610560,2611180," There we go."
2611180,2617840," Then, I'm going to map each individual word and turn it into a bag of words."
2618240,2620800," Two word, two bag of words."
2620800,2622060," And there we go."
2622060,2627820," It doesn't show anything because I forgot to implement a showable interface."
2627820,2630480," Deriving show."
2630480,2632380," There we go."
2632380,2637500," And I probably have to recompile everything."
2637500,2639280," There we go."
2639280,2642820," So, here we have a list of bag of words."
2642820,2644580," So, here is the list of bag of words."
2644880,2648360," And each bag of words contains a single word."
2648360,2650360," So, we have a list of bag of words."
2650360,2652380," And it contains a single word there."
2652380,2656540," Now, we have a very interesting operation called fold."
2656540,2659560," Which is not available right now."
2659560,2661420," Because I don't remember where it is."
2661620,2663600," I think it's somewhere in the standard library."
2663600,2664940," Let me check it out real quick."
2664940,2666660," Fold."
2666660,2669120," It's in data foldable."
2669120,2669400," Okay."
2669400,2673060," So, let's import data foldable."
2673060,2674440," And recompile everything."
2674440,2675240," Okay."
2675240,2676740," So, if you take a look at fold."
2676740,2681600," It takes a list of mannoids."
2681600,2684380," And returns you a single mannoid."
2686620,2691000," A mannoid is a system where you have a binary operation."
2691000,2692700," What it does."
2692700,2695880," It uses information about binary operation of a mannoid."
2695880,2697120," And its initial element."
2697120,2700340," To fold all of the mannoids into a single one."
2700340,2702580," You see where I'm going?"
2702580,2703760," See where I'm going?"
2703760,2704900," So, now."
2704900,2707040," Here's the list of bag of words."
2707040,2710300," And I fold all of them into a single bag of words."
2710300,2712360," About that."
2712820,2715220," Using the power of mannoids and semi groups."
2715220,2718280," So, that's why we need these interfaces."
2718280,2718700," Right."
2718700,2719880," So, essentially."
2719880,2722220," These interfaces enable you with just."
2722220,2722520," You know."
2722520,2724820," Quickly define a bunch of small mannoids."
2724820,2726980," And just merge them into a single one."
2726980,2729060," And this is how we can collect the statistics."
2729060,2730000," So, yeah."
2730000,2736820," You should make a tutorial on Husker someday."
2736820,2738540," Maybe I should."
2738540,2739060," Yeah."
2739060,2741120," Maybe I'll do."
2741120,2741820," At some point."
2741820,2742940," But, yeah."
2742940,2744560," So, this is how we can do that."
2744560,2745340," So, and."
2745340,2747080," Taking a sentence."
2747080,2749460," And turning it into a bag of words."
2749460,2750940," Is as simple as applying."
2750940,2752200," Like three functions."
2752200,2753500," Split it into words."
2753500,2755020," Map words to bag of words."
2755020,2756780," And just fold all of that into a single one."
2756780,2757800," Does it make sense?"
2757800,2758760," Hopefully."
2758760,2762560," Do you know about fold map?"
2762560,2762880," Yes."
2762880,2764500," I do know about fold map."
2764500,2765760," It doesn't matter."
2765760,2766820," It's the same thing."
2766820,2772020," Bike shading, by the way."
2772020,2776920," So, what is the number?"
2776920,2778960," The amount of words in the sentence."
2778960,2782500," So, how many words do we have in the sentence?"
2784400,2786600," And by the way."
2786600,2790260," Maintaining the bag of words for the spam."
2790260,2792000," And maintaining the bag of words for the ham."
2792000,2793420," Is super simple."
2793420,2797240," You take your original bag of words."
2797240,2798820," You take a new message."
2798820,2799500," Right?"
2799500,2802580," You just turn it into a bag of words."
2802580,2804800," And you merge it with the one that you keep maintaining."
2805340,2807460," So, it just makes it a whole lot easier."
2807460,2809740," Thank you, Mr. Scalder, too."
2809740,2813300," Hello, Ford."
2813300,2814060," Welcome to the stream."
2814060,2818300," Oh, this is not for you."
2818300,2820720," It was for Supercuber."
2820720,2821900," But yeah, there we go."
2821900,2823060," There's a special comment on that."
2823060,2824580," Okay."
2824580,2827080," So, that should be it."
2827080,2831100," And another thing I want to do."
2832380,2833740," I want to be able to"
2833740,2837300," I want to be able to"
2837300,2839120," take a bag of words"
2839120,2840520," and then a word"
2840520,2843960," and just get the probability of that word."
2843960,2844360," Right?"
2844360,2846460," So, let me try."
2846460,2849420," Probability."
2849420,2852220," Maybe word probability."
2852220,2853500," So,"
2853500,2856060," it takes a bag of words."
2856060,2860120," Maybe it should first take the word."
2862380,2863020," Like this."
2863020,2865500," And return the probability."
2865500,2867680," And we're going to store the probability as a float."
2867680,2868040," Right?"
2868040,2869900," Because it's going to be a value from 0 to 1."
2869900,2870840," Right."
2870840,2872080," To be fair,"
2872080,2872460," like,"
2872460,2874280," it's kind of difficult to distinguish"
2874280,2875840," a word"
2875840,2877560," from just a text."
2877560,2878820," Maybe we need to introduce"
2878820,2879880," like a type alias"
2879880,2881020," called word."
2881020,2882040," And I think"
2882040,2883960," that name is already taken."
2883960,2887580," I think that name is already taken."
2887740,2888600," there is like"
2888600,2889820," data word"
2889820,2890720," module."
2890720,2893060," And they have types"
2893060,2893440," like"
2893440,2895120," I wish the pages"
2895120,2896040," were a little bit smaller"
2896040,2897420," so they would load up"
2897420,2898280," a little bit faster."
2898280,2899700," But the Haskell developers"
2899700,2900780," like huge pages"
2900780,2901920," that load for ages."
2901920,2903500," An intentional rhyme,"
2903500,2903940," by the way."
2903940,2905860," Yeah."
2905860,2906720," It's just like"
2906720,2907740," I cannot do anything"
2907740,2909380," because the page is still loading."
2909380,2910860," This is how huge it is."
2910860,2911120," Like,"
2911120,2912760," it's enormously like huge."
2912840,2913980," it's just still loading."
2913980,2916340," Yeah."
2916340,2921220," And"
2921220,2922540," it's especially slow"
2922540,2923060," on my machine"
2923060,2924380," because I'm also streaming from that."
2924380,2924600," Okay."
2924600,2925360," Thank you very much."
2925360,2926260," All right."
2926260,2926540," So,"
2926540,2927600," we do have a word"
2927600,2928620," and it's an unsigned"
2928620,2929860," integral type."
2929860,2930160," Okay."
2930160,2930380," So,"
2930380,2932320," that kind of creates a problem."
2932320,2932540," So,"
2932540,2933840," maybe I'm not going to do that right now."
2933840,2938960," So,"
2938960,2941160," here's the word"
2941160,2942840," and"
2942840,2944060," here's this thing."
2944060,2945100," So,"
2945100,2946560," what we need to do,"
2946560,2948300," we need to take"
2948300,2951920," the amount of these words"
2951920,2953640," in the bag of words."
2953640,2954460," So,"
2954460,2955720," we can do that"
2955720,2956280," by using"
2956280,2957420," lookup function,"
2957420,2957820," right?"
2957820,2959240," We can do a lookup function."
2959240,2961740," So,"
2961740,2962860," we're going to look up"
2962860,2965500," this word"
2965500,2967580," in the bag of words."
2967580,2968080," But,"
2968080,2969360," we also need to"
2969360,2970580," destructurize it,"
2970580,2970880," right?"
2970940,2971240," otherwise,"
2971240,2971840," we won't be able"
2971840,2972460," to do anything."
2972460,2974400," And that returns us"
2974400,2974860," maybe."
2974860,2978020," That returns us"
2978020,2978300," maybe."
2978300,2979020," And if"
2979020,2980280," we cannot find"
2980280,2980820," the word"
2980820,2981900," in the bag of words,"
2981900,2982620," we're going to assume"
2982620,2983120," that the amount"
2983120,2983720," of these words"
2983720,2984520," is zero."
2984520,2985320," So,"
2985320,2986200," for that,"
2986200,2987020," we can have"
2987020,2988140," functions from"
2988140,2988420," maybe,"
2988420,2989320," which is"
2989320,2990120," available"
2990120,2991380," in the module"
2991380,2992200," data maybe,"
2992200,2993280," right?"
2993280,2994080," And if,"
2994080,2994880," for example,"
2994880,2995520," nothing,"
2995520,2996980," we should be able to,"
2996980,2997320," okay,"
2997320,2998000," I will have to"
2998000,2998780," recompile it."
2999280,2999500," so,"
2999500,3001880," from maybe"
3001880,3002820," zero."
3002820,3004020," Right."
3004020,3005360," That gives us"
3005360,3007020," the amount"
3007020,3007820," of those words"
3007820,3008760," in the bag,"
3008760,3009260," right?"
3009260,3010260," Something like this."
3010260,3011120," And then,"
3011120,3011740," what we need to do,"
3011740,3012740," we need to define,"
3012740,3015800," we need to divide"
3015800,3016920," that by"
3016920,3019100," the whole amount"
3019100,3019720," of words"
3019720,3021360," in the bag of words."
3021740,3022200," So,"
3022200,3023780," how can we know?"
3023780,3025020," So,"
3025020,3025700," words count."
3025700,3026760," Let's implement"
3026760,3027200," an operation"
3027200,3027600," that takes"
3027600,3028280," a bag of words"
3028280,3029180," and returns us"
3029180,3030380," the whole amount"
3030380,3030880," of words."
3030880,3031500," So,"
3031500,3032260," to do that,"
3032260,3033420," we'll need to"
3033420,3034320," sum up"
3034320,3036840," all of the values"
3036840,3038540," of this bag of words."
3038540,3040540," So,"
3040540,3041820," as far as I know,"
3041820,3042480," you can literally"
3042480,3043220," just take"
3043220,3045140," a map,"
3045140,3046660," you can just"
3046660,3047280," take a map,"
3047280,3048820," turn it into"
3048820,3049300," a list,"
3049300,3049880," right,"
3049880,3050380," like this."
3050380,3051400," Then,"
3051400,3052360," you can map it."
3052360,3053080," So,"
3053080,3055320," when you turn"
3055320,3056280," a map into a list,"
3056280,3057160," you get a list"
3057160,3057860," of pairs,"
3057860,3058440," key,"
3058440,3058900," value,"
3058900,3059260," key,"
3059260,3059700," value,"
3059700,3060000," key,"
3060000,3060440," value."
3060440,3060960," So,"
3060960,3061280," that means"
3061280,3061620," we need to"
3061620,3062700," extract the second"
3062700,3063460," value and just"
3063460,3064340," sum everything up."
3064340,3064800," So,"
3064800,3065500," that's going to be"
3065500,3066460," the thing that"
3066460,3067140," counts words."
3067140,3068000," And,"
3068000,3069100," yeah,"
3069100,3069760," we can just do"
3069760,3071800," words count"
3071800,3073100," for that specific"
3073100,3074100," bag of words."
3074100,3075600," But,"
3075600,3077240," this is an integer"
3077240,3078580," and this is an integer"
3078580,3079160," as well."
3079160,3079800," So,"
3079800,3080560," that's not going to"
3080560,3080780," work."
3080780,3081380," We need to convert"
3081380,3082020," them to floats."
3082020,3082740," As far as I know,"
3082740,3083480," the easiest way to do"
3083480,3084260," that is just to call"
3084260,3084920," from integral."
3084920,3086920," Don't ask me how"
3086920,3087520," that works."
3087520,3088500," It just works."
3088500,3092460," From integral."
3092460,3093340," There we go."
3093340,3094080," So,"
3094080,3095540," that should work,"
3095540,3096460," but it doesn't"
3096460,3097460," because..."
3097460,3104960," Oh, yeah."
3104960,3106280," Because this thing"
3106280,3107140," has to be"
3107140,3107980," bag of words."
3108340,3111060," got them."
3111060,3111640," Okay."
3111640,3113960," So,"
3113960,3114840," that means I'll have"
3114840,3115620," to do it like that."
3115620,3117040," And then,"
3117040,3117500," here,"
3117500,3119880," I'll need to convert"
3119880,3120160," it"
3120160,3122400," to map."
3122400,3123940," And now,"
3123940,3124260," it compiles."
3124260,3124480," Okay."
3124480,3125680," So,"
3125680,3127440," we have an operation"
3127440,3128540," that counts"
3128540,3129480," the probabilities."
3129480,3130440," Right."
3130440,3131280," So,"
3131280,3132020," now,"
3132020,3132720," let's take our"
3132720,3133560," original thing."
3134560,3136060," here is our"
3136060,3137220," bag of words."
3137220,3137860," So,"
3137860,3138380," here it is."
3138380,3139740," And we can"
3139740,3140220," pick"
3140220,3141880," some word from it,"
3141880,3142580," like lorem,"
3142580,3143560," and take a look"
3143560,3144080," at its probability,"
3144080,3145180," like word probability."
3145180,3147740," Word probability,"
3147740,3149560," this is it."
3149960,3151780," And here is the probability."
3151780,3152720," It's very low,"
3152720,3153220," apparently."
3153220,3158740," The."
3158740,3159840," How about the?"
3159840,3160820," Yeah,"
3160820,3161180," the,"
3161180,3162320," it actually has"
3162320,3163220," a higher probability"
3163220,3163980," because there's"
3163980,3164540," like at least"
3164540,3165300," three of them."
3165300,3166140," Right."
3166360,3166780," So,"
3166780,3167160," essentially,"
3167160,3168080," like how does"
3168080,3168780," it calculate probability?"
3168780,3169820," It just takes three"
3169820,3170880," and divides it"
3170880,3171600," by the sum"
3171600,3172380," of all of these"
3172380,3172940," numbers here."
3172940,3173980," It's very simple."
3173980,3174760," It's very straightforward."
3174760,3177560," Right."
3177560,3178160," So,"
3178160,3178800," now,"
3178800,3179760," we have"
3179760,3180840," ways to build"
3180840,3181720," a bag of words"
3181720,3182800," and also count"
3182800,3183580," word probabilities."
3183580,3185060," And that should"
3185060,3185700," be enough"
3185700,3186840," to train"
3186840,3187440," things,"
3187440,3188100," actually."
3188100,3190540," That is already"
3190540,3191260," enough to train"
3191260,3191600," things."
3191600,3192740," The only problem"
3192740,3193160," is that"
3193160,3194160," we don't have"
3194160,3194740," a way to"
3194740,3195240," dump"
3195240,3196280," a bag of words"
3196280,3196760," to"
3196760,3198060," file system."
3198060,3200840," Maybe we can,"
3200840,3201660," maybe we can just,"
3201660,3201960," you know,"
3201960,3203080," this thing is showable."
3203080,3204640," We can essentially"
3204640,3206120," just implement"
3206120,3206920," the read interface"
3206920,3207260," for it."
3207260,3207720," And there we go."
3207720,3208540," We have serialization,"
3208540,3209180," deserialization."
3209180,3210340," Maybe for now,"
3210340,3211120," we don't need"
3211120,3213220," any special databases"
3213220,3214120," or anything like that."
3214120,3214940," We can just use"
3214940,3216200," like files"
3216200,3217280," or whatnot."
3217280,3218400," Maybe even JSON."
3218400,3219140," Whatever."
3219140,3225920," So,"
3226200,3229460," now we need"
3229460,3230040," something,"
3230040,3231840," some data"
3231840,3232520," to train"
3232520,3233300," our models."
3233300,3235520," Where can"
3235520,3235820," we get"
3235820,3236360," that data?"
3236360,3238720," Spam"
3238720,3240100," datasets."
3240100,3241900," Let's,"
3241900,3242340," let's find"
3242340,3242580," some"
3242580,3243980," spam datasets."
3243980,3248000," Spam"
3248000,3248360," ham"
3248360,3249440," mail datasets."
3251560,3252160," So,"
3252160,3252340," so maybe"
3252340,3253140," we can find"
3253140,3253780," something here."
3253780,3254520," Does anybody"
3254520,3255140," know any"
3255140,3255580," good,"
3255580,3256440," you know,"
3256440,3256940," datasets"
3256940,3259820," that we could use?"
3259820,3261640," I don't know"
3261640,3262060," what it is"
3262060,3262580," and I don't know"
3262580,3263080," why does it"
3263080,3263560," take so much"
3263560,3264380," time to load it up."
3264380,3265580," So,"
3265580,3266320," this is a solution"
3266320,3266900," in Python."
3266900,3268640," Excuse me,"
3268640,3269260," spoilers,"
3269260,3270320," we're not going to use that."
3272940,3273880," I'm going to use that."
3273880,3275540," Spam"
3275540,3275880," ham."
3275880,3276460," Okay,"
3276460,3277120," so there's like"
3277120,3278240," five megabytes of that."
3278240,3279400," Can we download this thing?"
3279400,3280960," Please don't tell me"
3280960,3281420," I have to"
3281420,3283040," have an account"
3283040,3283680," there or something."
3283680,3284820," Oh, damn it."
3286100,3286780," All right."
3286780,3287800," So,"
3287800,3291700," you want"
3291700,3292060," the spam"
3292060,3292400," dataset?"
3292400,3297300," Oh,"
3297300,3298500," you're generating"
3298500,3298700," it."
3298700,3298880," Okay."
3298880,3300380," Okay."
3300380,3301260," Email classification"
3301260,3301920," spam or ham."
3301920,3302860," This work is a part"
3302860,3303640," of mini project."
3303640,3304000," Okay."
3304000,3306980," Email classification."
3306980,3307460," So,"
3307460,3308220," there's a spam."
3308220,3310300," Oh,"
3310300,3310600," that,"
3310600,3310940," oh,"
3310940,3311400," shit."
3311400,3312020," That's actually"
3312020,3312360," cool."
3312360,3312540," So,"
3312540,3312880," we have"
3312880,3313560," something here."
3316100,3316540," Oh,"
3316540,3316980," shit."
3316980,3318600," Okay."
3318600,3319020," So,"
3319020,3319960," can we use"
3319960,3320560," this thing?"
3320560,3321820," And there's also"
3321820,3322200," ham."
3322200,3324960," Nice."
3324960,3326720," Absolutely nice."
3326720,3327240," Okay."
3327240,3327540," Okay."
3327540,3328400," We're going to use that."
3328400,3328700," Hopefully."
3328700,3329300," What's the license"
3329300,3329860," of this thing?"
3329860,3331620," There's no license."
3331620,3341640," They didn't provide"
3341640,3342300," any license."
3342300,3343560," What the fuck?"
3343560,3346060," What the fuck?"
3346100,3348400," Well,"
3348400,3348620," I mean,"
3348620,3349220," it's publicly"
3349220,3349860," available."
3349860,3353840," Datasets."
3353840,3354400," Oh,"
3354400,3354600," okay."
3354600,3355840," Oh,"
3355840,3356080," okay."
3356080,3356300," So,"
3356300,3356760," they took it"
3356760,3357360," from here."
3357360,3361520," A spam"
3361520,3362040," of ham messages"
3362040,3362740," into the set"
3362740,3363220," we use"
3363220,3363720," is taken"
3363720,3364400," from link"
3364400,3364840," here."
3364840,3371380," I don't know"
3371380,3371760," what it is,"
3371760,3372280," but okay."
3372280,3373200," Here in one."
3376100,3379620," anyway,"
3379620,3379900," I'm going"
3379900,3380260," to just take"
3380260,3380640," this one."
3380640,3381680," That's it."
3381680,3382520," All right."
3382520,3382780," So,"
3382780,3383280," I'm also going"
3383280,3383620," to create"
3383620,3384040," a readme"
3384040,3385680," and"
3385680,3389420," we're going"
3389420,3389760," to put it"
3389760,3390420," into references."
3390420,3391380," We're going"
3391380,3391680," to put it"
3391680,3392280," into references"
3392280,3392960," and that's"
3392960,3393320," basically"
3393320,3393640," what we"
3393640,3394060," used here."
3394760,3395000," okay."
3395000,3396800," So,"
3396800,3398200," I'm going"
3398200,3398600," to just clone"
3398600,3398760," it."
3398760,3400060," I'm just going"
3400060,3400360," to clone"
3400360,3401020," it and"
3401020,3401640," we'll see."
3401640,3402100," We'll see."
3402100,3403780," It's a bold move."
3403780,3406780," Yeah."
3408740,3409140," I mean,"
3409140,3409720," Vetchina"
3409720,3411520," is a ham"
3411520,3412700," in Russian."
3412700,3413700," And not only"
3413700,3414000," in Russian,"
3414000,3414580," probably like"
3414580,3415380," in other Slavic"
3415380,3416200," languages as well."
3416200,3417920," So,"
3417920,3418840," email classification"
3418840,3419560," test"
3419560,3421220," S or H."
3421220,3422200," So,"
3422200,3422720," how does"
3422720,3423720," ham look like,"
3423720,3424220," by the way?"
3424220,3424680," How does"
3424680,3425320," ham look like?"
3425320,3428500," So,"
3428500,3428980," subject."
3428980,3431440," Hmm."
3431440,3432460," So,"
3432460,3432960," this is like"
3432960,3434960," a farmer."
3438340,3441080," These are"
3441080,3441960," really strange"
3441960,3442840," emails,"
3442840,3443420," but okay."
3443420,3448180," Okay."
3448180,3448420," So,"
3448420,3448720," we're going"
3448720,3449080," to have"
3449080,3449920," something like"
3449920,3450440," data"
3450440,3452220," and we're"
3452220,3452340," going to"
3452340,3452760," just put it"
3452760,3453100," here."
3453100,3454100," Just put it"
3454100,3454400," here."
3454400,3455860," And"
3455860,3458860," we don't"
3458860,3459260," really need"
3459260,3459520," much,"
3459520,3460000," to be fair."
3460000,3460760," We don't"
3460760,3461140," really need"
3461140,3461400," much."
3461400,3462960," We just"
3462960,3463360," need this"
3463360,3463640," kind of"
3463640,3463860," stuff."
3463860,3465860," So,"
3465860,3466140," I need"
3466140,3466640," a function"
3466640,3467580," that would"
3467580,3467940," take a"
3467940,3468560," folder,"
3468560,3469920," take a"
3469920,3470180," folder,"
3470180,3471060," take all"
3471060,3471280," of the"
3471280,3471700," files in"
3471700,3472160," that folder"
3472160,3472880," and give"
3472880,3473200," me the"
3473200,3473620," bag of"
3473620,3473960," words"
3473960,3474600," for"
3474600,3475080," each"
3475080,3475400," individual"
3475400,3475640," file."
3475640,3476120," We can"
3476120,3476440," start"
3476440,3476760," with,"
3476760,3478720," you know,"
3478720,3480140," with just"
3480140,3480600," a function"
3480600,3481280," that takes"
3481280,3482260," a single"
3482260,3482660," file,"
3482660,3483100," right?"
3483100,3484020," Bo"
3484020,3485660," from"
3485660,3486060," file,"
3486060,3486660," right?"
3486660,3487640," It accepts"
3487640,3488460," the file path"
3488460,3490060," and returns"
3490060,3491180," a bag of"
3491180,3491380," words."
3491380,3492160," So,"
3492160,3492580," what's"
3492580,3492820," interesting"
3492820,3493140," is that"
3493140,3493800," it performs"
3493800,3494220," I.O"
3494220,3495060," because"
3495060,3495640," reading"
3495640,3496880," from a"
3496880,3497240," file"
3497240,3497880," performs"
3497880,3498040," a"
3498040,3498240," side"
3498240,3498580," effect,"
3498580,3498960," right?"
3498960,3499220," Because"
3499220,3499460," it's"
3499460,3499940," essentially"
3499940,3500660," interacting"
3500660,3501180," with"
3501180,3501700," the"
3501700,3501960," real"
3501960,3502340," world."
3502340,3503540," That's"
3503540,3503780," why we"
3503780,3504020," have to"
3504020,3504220," do it"
3504220,3504340," like"
3504340,3504560," that."
3504560,3507940," All right."
3507940,3509640," So,"
3509640,3510860," how can"
3510860,3511080," we do"
3511080,3511320," that?"
3511320,3514840," In"
3514840,3515240," Haskell,"
3515240,3515520," we have"
3515520,3515960," a function"
3515960,3516260," called"
3516260,3516780," readfile,"
3516780,3517020," which"
3517020,3517380," essentially"
3517380,3518000," just reads"
3518000,3518580," the whole"
3518580,3519140," thing"
3519140,3520380," into a"
3520380,3520620," string."
3520620,3521280," But we"
3521280,3521540," are not"
3521540,3521780," using"
3521780,3522160," strings,"
3522260,3522480," we're"
3522480,3522880," using"
3522880,3524260," text,"
3524260,3524960," which is"
3524960,3525700," like a"
3525700,3526060," third-party"
3526060,3526580," dependency."
3526580,3528680," The"
3528680,3528980," problem"
3528980,3529240," with"
3529240,3529720," strings"
3529720,3530000," in"
3530000,3530360," Haskell"
3530360,3530960," is that"
3530960,3531360," they"
3531360,3531900," are"
3531900,3533660," literally"
3533660,3534640," list"
3534640,3534920," of"
3534920,3535480," characters."
3535480,3536120," So,"
3536120,3536420," this is"
3536420,3536760," how they"
3536760,3537160," defined"
3537160,3537540," in the"
3537540,3537780," standard"
3537780,3538060," library"
3538060,3538200," of"
3538200,3538440," Haskell."
3538440,3538700," They're"
3538700,3538900," a list"
3538900,3539060," of"
3539060,3539400," characters"
3539400,3539700," and"
3539700,3540060," list"
3540060,3540340," in"
3540340,3540840," Haskell"
3540840,3542100," is a"
3542100,3542400," linked"
3542400,3542860," list."
3542860,3544740," I'm not"
3544740,3545220," even joking."
3545220,3546160," Haskell,"
3546160,3547020," by default,"
3547400,3547760," uses"
3547760,3548360," linked"
3548360,3548760," lists"
3548760,3549220," to"
3549220,3549720," represent"
3549720,3550440," strings."
3550440,3551760," Yes,"
3551760,3552720," this is"
3552720,3553020," not a"
3553020,3553260," joke."
3553260,3554620," It is"
3554620,3554900," what it"
3554900,3555140," is."
3555140,3555860," And that's"
3555860,3557040," why in"
3557040,3557880," real-world"
3557880,3558340," Haskell"
3558340,3558780," application,"
3558780,3559360," nobody"
3559360,3559800," uses"
3559800,3560380," strings,"
3560380,3561000," right?"
3561000,3561720," Because you're"
3561720,3561840," going to"
3561840,3562220," end up"
3562220,3563220," with a"
3563220,3564300," very low"
3564300,3564900," performance."
3564900,3566320," And everyone"
3566320,3566760," uses"
3566760,3567200," text."
3567200,3567620," It's a"
3567620,3568040," third-party"
3568040,3568500," dependency"
3568500,3568840," which"
3568840,3569280," basically"
3569280,3569820," implements"
3569820,3571460," efficient"
3571460,3572420," strings"
3572420,3573960," for Haskell."
3573960,3574760," And so"
3574760,3575340," text,"
3575760,3577560," the thing"
3577560,3577840," that we"
3577840,3578280," use here"
3578280,3578780," is"
3578780,3579180," essentially"
3579180,3579580," like a"
3579580,3579900," binary"
3579900,3580540," contiguous"
3580540,3580980," buffer"
3580980,3581420," in the"
3581420,3581740," memory,"
3581740,3582380," right?"
3582380,3582900," But it"
3582900,3583280," implements"
3583280,3583660," all of"
3583660,3583900," the"
3583900,3584460," string"
3584460,3585060," operations"
3585060,3585340," like"
3585340,3585480," as"
3585480,3585860," usual."
3585860,3593700," Okay."
3593700,3595820," And"
3595820,3596440," because of"
3596440,3596680," that,"
3596680,3597180," we're not"
3597180,3597400," going to"
3597400,3597700," use"
3597700,3598060," a"
3598060,3598200," read"
3598200,3598480," file,"
3598480,3598720," right?"
3598720,3598940," Because"
3598940,3599120," read"
3599120,3599320," file"
3599320,3599560," works"
3599560,3599720," with"
3599720,3599940," strings."
3599940,3600180," But"
3600180,3600360," as"
3600360,3600520," far"
3600520,3600660," as"
3600660,3600780," I"
3605760,3610180," replacements"
3610180,3611640," it"
3611640,3612560," doesn't."
3612560,3612900," Okay."
3612900,3613540," I just"
3613540,3613780," have a"
3613780,3614120," compilation"
3614120,3614480," error here."
3614480,3615300," So I"
3615300,3615720," think it"
3615720,3615920," has"
3615920,3616180," something"
3616180,3616380," like"
3616380,3616600," read"
3616600,3616920," file"
3616920,3617320," here,"
3617320,3617800," if I'm"
3617800,3617940," not"
3617940,3618360," mistaken."
3618360,3619200," Yeah,"
3619200,3619420," there we"
3619420,3619560," go."
3619560,3620020," So it's"
3620020,3620320," essentially"
3620320,3620800," like a"
3620800,3621160," classical"
3621160,3621440," read"

3622140,3622400," the"
3622400,3622800," prelude,"
3622800,3623780," but"
3623780,3624520," it"
3624520,3624820," returns"
3624820,3625020," the"
3625020,3625320," text,"
3625320,3625660," right?"
3625660,3625860," And"
3625860,3626000," this"
3626000,3626100," is"
3626100,3626400," exactly"
3626400,3626600," what"

3630000,3630120," do"
3630120,3630360," here,"
3630360,3630740," we can"

3732140,3732680," projects."
3732680,3733020," Is"
3733020,3733140," that"
3733140,3733260," what"
3733260,3733380," you're"
3733380,3733560," talking"

3736020,3737320," Relude is"

3737520,3738380," Okay."
3738380,3746600," Maybe"
3746600,3746960," we'll"
3746960,3747280," take a"
3747280,3747480," look at"
3747480,3747700," it at"
3747700,3747840," some"
3747840,3748140," point."
3748140,3748480," But"
3748480,3749800," usually"
3749800,3751180," I"
3751180,3751680," compensate"
3751680,3752720," for"
3752720,3753580," like"
3753580,3754180," by using"
3754180,3754600," the"
3754600,3754880," text"

3755420,3755740," instead"

3756220,3756880," And"
3756880,3757240," also"
3757240,3757740," quite"
3757740,3757980," often"
3757980,3758300," I"
3758300,3758840," use"
3758840,3759240," this"
3759240,3759540," thing."
3759540,3759840," It's"
3759840,3760000," a"
3760000,3760300," safe"
3760300,3760680," package"
3760680,3761020," which"
3761020,3761760," introduces"

3765060,3765320," that."
3765320,3766960," Yeah."
3766960,3767240," So"
3767240,3767540," usually"
3767540,3767740," it's"
3767740,3767980," enough"
3767980,3768140," for"
3768140,3768300," me."
3768300,3772080," Anyway,"
3772080,3772420," so"
3772420,3772740," this"
3772740,3772860," is"
3772860,3773020," how"
3773020,3773180," you"
3773180,3773340," can"
3773340,3773520," just"
3773520,3773720," take"
3773720,3773880," a"
3773880,3774100," single"
3774100,3774480," file"
3774480,3775000," and"
3775000,3778600," essentially"
3778600,3780220," turn"
3780220,3780460," it"
3780460,3781040," into"

3782020,3782340," And"
3782340,3782540," let's"
3782540,3782660," try"
3782660,3782780," to"
3782780,3783080," implement"
3783080,3783340," that."
3783340,3784240," So"
3784240,3784700," here's"
3784700,3785020," the"
3785020,3786140," file"

3790220,3795140," And"
3795140,3795300," there"
3795300,3795380," we"
3795380,3795560," go."
3795560,3797580," Should"
3797580,3797740," be"
3797740,3797960," pretty"
3797960,3798400," straightforward."
3798400,3799020," Sweep by"
3799020,3799580," words and"
3799580,3800020," turn it"
3800020,3800200," into"
3800200,3800440," that."
3800440,3801080," So"
3801080,3803740," maybe we"
3803740,3803920," can"
3803920,3803940," can"
3803940,3804460," even"

3810660,3810960," like"
3810960,3811180," this."
3811180,3811400," So"
3811400,3811520," we"
3811520,3811680," have"
3811680,3811820," a"

3812980,3813360," we"

3816220,3816740," bowl."
3816740,3817820," Right?"
3817820,3818720," And"
3818720,3819220," here's"
3819220,3819640," the text"
3819640,3820280," and"
3820280,3820800," maybe"
3820800,3821200," it can"
3821200,3821820," even be"

3824580,3824920," to"
3824920,3825360," bowl."
3826620,3828620," So"
3828620,3828940," we"

3830220,3830420," then"

3929940,3931040," All right,"
3931040,3931360," so,"
3931360,3931800," I think"
3931800,3932020," we'll"

3938940,3939140," it"
3939820,3940520," like"

3943540,3943820," that."
3943820,3949720," All right,"
3949720,3950800," so,"
3950800,3951560," and if"
3951560,3951760," we"
3951760,3952300," import"
3952300,3954560," system"
3954560,3955840," directory,"
3955840,3956080," oh,"
3956080,3956240," there we"
3956240,3956340," go,"
3956340,3956680," it even"
3956680,3957140," picks it"
3957140,3957300," up,"
3957300,3959140," I should"
3959140,3959420," be able"
3959420,3959760," to use"
3959760,3960260," functions"
3960260,3960600," like"
3960600,3961160," list"

3962140,3965140," That's"
3965140,3965680," pretty cool,"
3965680,3966260," not gonna"
3966260,3966520," lie,"
3966520,3967600," and then"
3967600,3967820," we're gonna"
3967820,3968040," have"
3968040,3968520," data,"
3969340,3969700," something"
3969700,3969960," like"
3969960,3970500," spam,"
3970500,3971280," and there"
3971280,3971520," we go,"
3971520,3971980," we got"
3971980,3972480," a list"
3972480,3972960," of all"
3972960,3973180," of the"
3973180,3973560," files."
3973560,3975160," That's"
3975160,3975420," actually"
3975420,3975720," super"
3975720,3976060," cool,"
3976060,3976440," that's"
3976440,3976940," so easy,"
3976940,3977300," you just"
3977300,3977700," do list"
3977700,3978100," directory"
3978100,3978480," and get"
3978480,3978760," a list"
3978760,3979080," of all"
3979080,3979380," of these"
3979380,3979940," things,"
3979940,3981180," and it's"
3981180,3981520," a list"
3981520,3981960," of file"
3981960,3982300," paths,"
3982300,3982660," but I"
3982660,3982780," mean,"
3982780,3983040," it's"
3983040,3983320," totally"
3983320,3983600," fine"
3983600,3983880," here."
3983880,3984840," All right,"
3984840,3985320," so,"
3985320,3986500," that means"
3986500,3986940," we can"
3986940,3987140," easily"
3987140,3987480," implement"
3987480,3987820," both"
3987820,3988060," from"
3988060,3988360," folder"
3988360,3988780," by doing"
3988780,3989040," something"
3989040,3989240," like"
3989240,3989480," this."
3989480,3990960," So,"
3990960,3991120," this"
3991120,3991240," is"
3991240,3991340," a"

3993860,3995400," hello"
3995400,3998100," did some"
3998100,3998340," of you"

4000520,4000760," with"
4000760,4001320," Comanet?"
4001320,4003260," I don't know,"
4003260,4003660," I already"
4003660,4004440," wasted Haskell"
4004440,4004820," on,"
4004820,4005640," I think,"
4005640,4006260," the second"
4006260,4006800," or first"
4006800,4007140," problem,"
4007140,4007880," so you can"
4007880,4008200," check out"
4008200,4008360," my"
4008360,4009000," Advent of Code"
4009000,4011140," repository,"
4011500,4012100," and I'm"
4012100,4012500," doing a"
4012500,4012720," very"
4012720,4013160," original"
4013160,4013680," challenge"
4013680,4014260," where I"
4014260,4014780," use a"
4014780,4015000," different"
4015000,4015400," language"
4015400,4016980," for each"
4016980,4017240," day,"
4017240,4018260," and I"
4018260,4018460," already"
4018460,4019180," wasted Haskell,"
4019180,4019500," I'm sorry,"
4019500,4020160," I wasted Haskell"
4020160,4020440," on the"
4020440,4020640," second"
4020640,4020940," day,"
4020940,4021960," and Rust"
4021960,4022160," on the"
4022160,4022380," first"
4022380,4022880," one."
4022880,4023440," So,"
4023440,4024120," and I,"
4024120,4024580," yeah,"
4024580,4025580," that's the"
4025580,4025840," languages"
4025840,4026320," I left"
4026320,4026600," with."
4026600,4029660," So,"
4029660,4030120," I haven't"
4030120,4030460," touched"
4030460,4031280," 10th or"
4031280,4031740," 11th"
4031740,4032260," problem yet,"
4032260,4032580," so I"
4032580,4033360," haven't even"
4033360,4033760," read them,"
4033760,4034140," so I don't"
4034140,4034400," know what"
4034400,4035020," they're all"
4035020,4035280," about."
4035280,4036100," Okay,"
4036100,4036560," so here's"
4036560,4036840," the list"
4036840,4037720," directory,"
4037720,4038260," right,"
4038260,4039360," so,"
4039360,4040340," and what's"
4040340,4040720," the next"
4040720,4041200," thing we can"
4041200,4041540," do,"
4041540,4043460," we'll"
4043460,4043760," probably"
4043760,4044440," have to"
4044440,4045580," do something"
4045580,4046000," like this"
4046000,4046460," where we're"
4046460,4047280," gonna map"
4047280,4049160," M with"
4049160,4049780," bow from"
4049780,4050240," file,"
4050240,4054320," and I guess"
4054320,4054680," that's the"
4054680,4055360," whole implementation,"
4055360,4056080," is it,"
4056080,4056520," is it the"
4056520,4057100," whole implementation?"
4057100,4057660," No,"
4057660,4059680," yeah,"
4059680,4060360," damn,"
4060360,4061000," why is it"
4061000,4061380," not,"
4061380,4062900," because bow"
4062900,4063660," from file"
4063660,4065480," couldn't,"
4065480,4066460," oh,"
4066460,4066800," I see,"
4066800,4067820," so you"
4067820,4068660," map M"
4068660,4069020," them,"
4069020,4069620," and you"
4069620,4069900," get the"
4069900,4070340," list of"
4070340,4070600," these"
4070600,4071420," bows,"
4071420,4073660," and after"
4073660,4074140," that,"
4074140,4075080," you have"
4075080,4075980," to"
4075980,4078400," actually"
4078400,4079000," fold"
4079000,4079340," them,"
4079340,4081560," no,"
4081560,4086760," is there"
4086760,4087320," something like"
4087320,4088320," fold M,"
4088320,4089220," is there"
4089220,4089780," something like"
4089780,4090620," fold M"
4090620,4092360," in Haskell,"
4092360,4093400," so basically"
4093400,4093980," fold,"
4093980,4094800," but also"
4094800,4095220," with"
4095220,4096020," one"
4096020,4097740," like fold"
4097740,4098300," L"
4098300,4098900," M,"
4098900,4100740," okay,"
4100740,4101420," I think"
4101420,4102020," it does"
4102020,4102600," exist,"
4102600,4105160," and how"
4105160,4105500," we're gonna"
4105500,4106280," actually fold"
4106280,4106400," them,"
4106400,4106880," if we're gonna,"
4106880,4109800," folding"
4109800,4110660," also should"
4110660,4111200," return"
4111200,4111800," a thing,"
4111800,4111820," yeah,"
4111820,4119120," so I"
4119120,4119440," think I'm"
4119440,4119780," not gonna"
4119780,4120300," try to"
4120300,4120800," be fancy,"
4120800,4121520," right,"
4121520,4122340," let's not"
4122340,4122760," try to"
4122760,4123160," be fancy,"
4123160,4123500," okay,"
4123500,4125100," and let's"
4125100,4125460," do something"
4125460,4125860," like this,"
4125860,4126300," files,"
4126300,4129060," then"
4129060,4132020," we're gonna"
4132020,4132640," have bows,"
4132640,4134460," so we"
4134460,4135140," basically"
4135140,4137060," map"
4137060,4137600," M"
4137600,4139180," bow"
4139180,4139520," from"
4139520,4140040," file"
4140040,4142780," from"
4142780,4143280," file,"
4143280,4144520," emacs,"
4144520,4145200," emacs,"
4145200,4145460," just"
4145460,4146660," autocomplete"
4146660,4146980," what I"
4146980,4147400," want,"
4147400,4147860," oh my"
4147860,4148240," god,"
4148240,4149260," and then"
4149260,4150080," what we"
4150080,4150320," just"
4150320,4150800," return"
4150800,4151420," is"
4151420,4154440," fold"
4154440,4155680," bows,"
4155680,4157160," is it"
4157160,4157620," gonna work,"
4157620,4157980," it does"
4157980,4158240," work,"
4158240,4158580," you see,"
4158580,4159800," so once"
4159800,4160160," you stop"
4160160,4160580," trying to"
4160580,4161060," be fancy,"
4161060,4161960," you actually"
4161960,4162300," end up"
4162300,4162660," with more"
4162660,4162980," readable"
4162980,4163460," code,"
4163460,4164100," you see,"
4164100,4164840," it's so"
4164840,4165160," readable,"
4165160,4165520," if I"
4165520,4165880," tried to"
4165880,4166220," do like"
4166220,4166520," this,"
4166520,4167540," you know,"
4167540,4168140," binding,"
4168140,4168980," fold m,"
4168980,4169600," fold map,"
4169600,4170160," nobody would"
4170160,4170700," be able to"
4170700,4171140," read that,"
4171140,4171820," but look at"
4171820,4172120," that,"
4172120,4173540," list directories,"
4173540,4173900," take the"
4173900,4174220," files,"
4174220,4174880," turn the"
4174880,4175360," files into"
4175360,4175660," bows,"
4175660,4176500," fold them,"
4176500,4176860," and there"
4176860,4177080," you go,"
4177080,4177360," you get"
4177360,4177900," the final"
4177900,4178140," bow,"
4178140,4179220," so,"
4179220,4179980," yeah,"
4179980,4180540," so,"
4180540,4182300," it's quite"
4182300,4183020," difficult to"
4183020,4184600," not try to"
4184600,4185140," be a smart"
4185140,4185520," ass in"
4185520,4185860," Haskell,"
4185860,4186300," because you"
4186300,4186680," kind of"
4186680,4187380," always want"
4187380,4187600," to,"
4187600,4188460," because it"
4188460,4189380," enables you"
4189380,4189740," with all"
4189740,4190040," of these"
4190040,4190800," quite cool"
4190800,4191220," things,"
4191220,4192260," but it's"
4192260,4192620," better to"
4192620,4192920," write it"
4192920,4193280," like that,"
4193280,4193740," it's just"
4193740,4194220," more readable,"
4194220,4195560," generally,"
4195560,4196720," okay,"
4196720,4198800," so,"
4198800,4199120," and that"
4199120,4199480," means we"
4199480,4199860," should be"
4199860,4200340," able to"
4200340,4200800," do the"
4200800,4201180," following"
4201180,4201780," thing,"
4201780,4204340," spam"
4204340,4205840," bowl,"
4205840,4209000," which is"
4209000,4209220," going to"
4209220,4209900," be"
4209900,4211200," bowl"
4211200,4212200," from"
4212200,4212700," folder,"
4212700,4213720," and where"
4213720,4213960," is the"
4213960,4214160," folder"
4214160,4214620," located?"
4214620,4215660," It's"
4215660,4216500," located in,"
4216500,4216840," oh my"
4216840,4217040," god,"
4217040,4217560," emacs,"
4217640,4217880," what the"
4217880,4218100," hell is"
4218100,4218320," wrong"
4218320,4218520," with"
4218520,4218700," you?"
4218700,4219720," Spam."
4219720,4221200," It's"
4221200,4221640," basically"
4221640,4222160," emacs"
4222160,4222580," is trying"
4222580,4222880," to be"
4222880,4223240," helpful,"
4223240,4223640," by the"
4223640,4223880," way."
4223880,4225600," Yeah,"
4225600,4226280," thank you"
4226280,4226800," very much,"
4226800,4227420," emacs,"
4227420,4228060," very cool."
4228060,4229080," Okay,"
4229080,4231060," and here's"
4231060,4231440," the ham."
4231440,4232160," So,"
4232160,4232640," now,"
4232640,4233440," automatically,"
4233440,4234540," if I try"
4234540,4235060," to access"
4235060,4235980," this thing,"
4235980,4236460," I can do"
4236460,4237160," words count,"
4237160,4239240," and it"
4239240,4239640," didn't,"
4239640,4240280," oh yeah,"
4240280,4240720," this is"
4240720,4241320," because it's"
4241320,4243300," exception,"
4243300,4244460," open file,"
4244460,4245180," file does not"
4245180,4245520," exist."
4245520,4246560," Oh shit,"
4246560,4246880," okay."
4246880,4250520," So,"
4250520,4251340," these are"
4251340,4253120," just regular"
4253120,4253700," files."
4253700,4255500," These are"
4255500,4256020," just regular"
4256020,4256520," files."
4256520,4257360," So,"
4257360,4258480," they are"
4258480,4259660," not full"
4259660,4261200," file names."
4261200,4262300," So,"
4262300,4263000," let me call it"
4263000,4263340," like that."
4263340,4263800," This is going"
4263800,4264000," to be"
4264000,4265040," folder path."
4265040,4266980," This is"
4266980,4267360," going to be"
4267360,4269480," file names,"
4269480,4271580," file names,"
4271580,4272860," and the next"
4272860,4273480," thing you have"
4273480,4273920," to do,"
4273920,4274400," actually,"
4274400,4275020," you have to"
4275020,4275940," take a"
4275940,4276820," single file"
4276820,4277540," name,"
4277540,4279660," and"
4279660,4283660," take a"
4283660,4284560," folder path,"
4284560,4286100," folder path,"
4286100,4287860," and merge"
4287860,4288520," it with"
4288520,4290140," the"
4290140,4291400," file name,"
4291400,4292780," like this."
4292780,4294380," And I"
4294380,4295060," think that"
4295060,4295800," will work."
4295800,4296620," Okay,"
4296620,4297240," so,"
4297240,4298180," you can count"
4298180,4298800," how many words"
4298800,4299500," in a spam"
4299500,4299960," you have,"
4299960,4300660," and you can"
4300660,4301480," count how many"
4301480,4302380," words in"
4302380,4303000," a ham"
4303000,4303420," you have."
4303420,4304620," There we go."
4304860,4305580," So,"
4305580,4306260," that's how many"
4306260,4306580," of them"
4306580,4307280," you have."
4307280,4310020," Yeah,"
4310020,4310300," so,"
4310300,4310700," essentially,"
4310700,4311180," we already"
4311180,4312440," build both"
4312440,4312680," of the"
4312680,4312980," models."
4312980,4314480," And what's"
4314480,4314860," funny is that"
4314860,4315400," we read"
4315400,4316060," them from,"
4316060,4316660," like,"
4316660,4317220," we build them"
4317220,4318020," every time"
4318020,4318860," we run"
4318860,4319380," this thing."
4319380,4320680," Yeah,"
4320680,4321740," so,"
4321740,4323620," we have both"
4323620,4324460," of the bags"
4324460,4324920," of words"
4324920,4325700," for spam"
4325700,4326440," and not spam."
4327440,4331380," Okay,"
4331380,4331820," but I wish"
4331820,4332200," I could"
4332200,4333960," do something"
4333960,4334540," about that."
4334540,4335800," Can we"
4335800,4338760," simplify it"
4338760,4339380," like this?"
4339380,4341580," I said that"
4341580,4342720," I'm trying not"
4342720,4343080," to be funny."
4343080,4343300," Yeah,"
4343300,4343600," there we go."
4343600,4343920," I actually"
4343920,4344900," simplified it."
4346080,4346920," Look at that."
4346920,4347740," Is that even"
4347740,4348140," readable?"
4348140,4349000," Can anyone"
4349000,4349980," decipher what"
4349980,4350300," the heck"
4350300,4350760," is that?"
4350760,4352160," Well,"
4352160,4352360," I mean,"
4352360,4352980," if you have"
4352980,4353520," experience with"
4353520,4353780," Haskell,"
4353780,4354180," you probably"
4354180,4354480," can,"
4354480,4355000," but I mean,"
4355000,4356620," so this is"
4356620,4357540," a partial"
4357540,4358140," application"
4358140,4358880," of binary"
4358880,4359440," operation."
4359440,4360080," we partially"
4360080,4360600," applied the"
4360600,4360960," first"
4360960,4362660," argument,"
4362660,4363360," right,"
4363360,4363700," and we"
4363700,4364480," compose it"
4364480,4364740," with a"
4364740,4365060," function"
4365060,4365560," bow from"
4365560,4365940," fire."
4365940,4367500," It's actually"
4367500,4368620," equivalent to"
4368620,4370840," this,"
4370840,4372780," right?"
4372780,4373460," So,"
4373460,4373960," essentially,"
4373960,4374900," I perform"
4374900,4375700," at a reduction,"
4375700,4377120," partially apply"
4377120,4377720," this thing,"
4377720,4378080," and I just"
4378080,4378660," compose these"
4378660,4379140," two functions"
4379140,4379480," together."
4379480,4381280," Yeah."
4381280,4384240," So,"
4384240,4384880," kind of"
4384880,4385060," cool."
4385060,4388200," Anyway,"
4388200,4388940," so we have"
4388940,4389420," both of"
4389420,4389880," the bags"
4389880,4390460," of words,"
4390460,4392200," and now,"
4392200,4393800," I think"
4393800,4394320," we're ready"
4394320,4394820," to do some"
4394820,4395300," classification."
4395300,4396000," You know,"
4396000,4396520," it would be"
4396520,4396900," kind of"
4396900,4398660," cool to"
4398660,4399800," actually train"
4399800,4401240," on half"
4401240,4401460," of the"
4401460,4401620," data."
4401620,4401980," You know,"
4401980,4402740," in the"
4402740,4404600," real"
4404600,4406300," machine learning,"
4406300,4406960," in the real"
4406960,4407540," machine learning,"
4407540,4408060," how people"
4408060,4408560," do it with"
4408560,4408800," that,"
4408800,4409980," they take"
4409980,4410540," their data,"
4410540,4411180," their training"
4411180,4411640," data,"
4411640,4412580," and they"
4412580,4413100," split it"
4413100,4413540," in half."
4413540,4414000," Like,"
4414000,4414540," half of the"
4414540,4415020," data is"
4415020,4415760," used for"
4415760,4416840," actual"
4416840,4417260," training,"
4417820,4418180," and"
4418180,4418860," another"
4418860,4419160," half"
4419160,4419420," is"
4419420,4419700," used"
4419700,4419940," for"
4419940,4420460," control."
4420460,4420920," Like,"
4420920,4421100," it's"
4421100,4421440," sort of"
4421440,4421580," like,"
4421580,4421840," I don't"
4421840,4421980," know"
4421980,4423080," the exact"
4423080,4423520," terminology,"
4423520,4424120," I think"
4424120,4424240," it's"
4424240,4424360," some"
4424360,4424520," sort"
4424520,4424640," of"
4424640,4425060," control"
4425060,4425440," data."
4425440,4426120," So,"
4426120,4426500," and that"
4426500,4426780," control"
4426780,4427180," data is"
4427180,4427520," the data"
4427520,4427800," that"
4427800,4428340," the model"
4428340,4428660," never"
4428660,4429040," seen"
4429040,4429420," before,"
4429420,4430180," right,"
4430180,4430520," and it's"
4430520,4430720," used"
4430720,4431140," to"
4431140,4431680," check"
4431680,4432480," how well"
4432480,4433100," the model"
4433100,4433620," performs."
4433980,4434260," I think"
4434260,4434540," we need"
4434540,4434640," to"
4434640,4434800," do"
4434800,4435120," something"
4435120,4435380," like"
4435380,4435600," that"
4435600,4435840," boys"
4435840,4436000," and"
4436000,4436160," girls."
4436160,4436520," I think"
4436520,4436800," we need"
4436800,4436860," to"
4436860,4437000," do"
4437000,4437260," something"
4437260,4437460," like"
4437460,4437600," that."
4437600,4441340," So,"
4441340,4442560," let me"
4442560,4443220," see."
4443220,4443780," So,"
4443780,4444460," now,"
4444460,4446200," I think"
4446200,4446520," I want to"
4446520,4446820," commit"
4446820,4447460," everything"
4447460,4447900," we have"
4447900,4448220," here."
4448220,4448980," I think"
4448980,4449280," I want to"
4449280,4449480," commit"
4449480,4449780," everything"
4449780,4450180," we have"
4450180,4450740," here,"
4450740,4451360," so it's"
4451360,4451600," already"
4451600,4451980," available."
4451980,4452280," So,"
4452280,4452860," gitignore."
4452860,4453960," What kind"
4453960,4454240," of stuff"
4454240,4454460," I want"
4454460,4454540," to"
4454540,4454700," ignore?"
4454700,4454840," I"
4454840,4455120," definitely"

4455320,4455380," to"
4455380,4455560," ignore"

4459760,4461040," in"
4461040,4461740," readme,"
4461740,4462360," so"

4464540,4464960," by the"
4464960,4465080," way,"
4465080,4465560," speaking of"
4465560,4465940," references,"
4465940,4466440," I also"
4466440,4466780," need to"
4466780,4467060," add"
4467060,4468700," the"
4468700,4470560," article"
4470560,4470900," that I"
4470900,4471120," used"

4475820,4476160," thank you so"
4476160,4476280," much."
4476280,4476760," I'm not"
4476760,4477140," like a"

4482340,4482980," so I"
4482980,4483300," may"
4483300,4483800," actually"
4483800,4484120," butcher"
4484120,4484300," the"

4486540,4486800," So,"
4486800,4487120," thank you,"
4487120,4487480," thank you so"

4498660,4500360," I don't"

4503980,4504300," nothing"

4505000,4505100," don't"
4505100,4505400," think we"

4615500,4617680," So,"

4641480,4643860," To be"
4643860,4644120," fair,"
4644120,4644980," maybe I"

4655580,4655820," I"
4655820,4655980," I'm"
4655980,4656080," going"

4657500,4658160," emphasize"
4658160,4658540," that"

4660060,4660500," of that"

4662840,4663400," as well."
4663400,4664640," Yes,"
4664640,4665020," I think"
4665020,4665940," that's going"
4665940,4666120," to be"
4666120,4666740," the thing."
4666740,4667160," To be"
4667160,4667300," fair,"
4667300,4667700," it just"
4667700,4667920," makes"
4667920,4668280," the word"
4668280,4668580," too"
4668580,4668980," long."
4668980,4670960," It looks"

4681320,4681480," think"
4681480,4681660," it's"

5324860,5325320," set"
5325320,5333560," but i mean"
5333560,5334200," we can"
5334200,5334420," change"
5334420,5334580," that"
5334580,5334840," later"
5334840,5339260," so"
5339260,5342060," yeah"
5342060,5342460," whatever"
5342460,5343260," i'm gonna"
5343260,5343620," fix that"

5363480,5363720," in the"

5366680,5367000," developing"
5367000,5367380," here"
5367380,5369240," okay"
5369240,5370660," so i"
5370660,5370960," think"
5370960,5372040," the moment"
5372040,5372600," of truth"
5372600,5373540," has come"
5373540,5376140," the moment"
5376140,5376620," of truth"
5376620,5377280," has come"
5377280,5378440," we need"
5378440,5378980," to implement"
5378980,5380440," a function"
5380440,5381640," that takes"
5381640,5382020," a word"
5382020,5383280," and"
5383280,5384080," give us"
5384080,5384680," the probability"
5384680,5385300," of that"
5385300,5385560," word"
5385560,5385860," being"

5389420,5390560," actually"
5390560,5390820," being"
5390820,5391260," being a"
5391260,5391440," spam"
5391440,5392000," specifically"
5392000,5392840," right"
5392840,5394280," so"
5394280,5394820," we need"
5394820,5395340," to implement"
5395340,5398340," this"
5398340,5398820," formula"
5398820,5400880," are you"
5400880,5401260," guys ready"
5401260,5403600," are you"
5403600,5403940," guys ready"
5403940,5405280," let's"
5405280,5405520," go"
5405520,5411020," can you"
5411020,5411300," do"
5411300,5411840," tutorial"
5411840,5412340," please"
5412340,5414460," okay"
5414460,5416900," so"
5416900,5417520," how"
5417520,5417660," are we"
5417660,5417800," going to"
5417800,5418100," call the"
5418100,5418560," function"

5426000,5427280," probability"
5427280,5428380," spam"
5428380,5428960," so we already"
5428960,5429520," have a word"
5429520,5429980," probability"
5429980,5431980," so we need"
5431980,5432380," to introduce"
5432380,5433060," word probability"
5433060,5433520," spam"
5433520,5435600," so in this"
5435600,5436480," thing"
5436480,5438260," word"
5438260,5439540," probability"
5439540,5440080," spam"

5445080,5445340," it's going"

5446040,5446620," spam"
5446620,5447200," bag of"

5447760,5448080," bag of"
5448080,5448260," word"
5448260,5449500," and it"
5449500,5450100," will return"
5450100,5450380," us the"
5450380,5450820," probability"
5450820,5451260," like in"
5451260,5451480," float"
5451480,5452000," from 0"
5452000,5452500," to 1"
5452500,5454760," okay"
5454760,5455460," and"
5455460,5456800," so first"
5456800,5457120," we need"
5457120,5457460," to take"
5457460,5457600," the"
5457600,5458060," probability"
5458060,5460060," of the"

5460360,5460880," if it"
5460880,5461140," is"
5461140,5461780," spam"
5461780,5463320," so we"
5463320,5463620," can even"
5463620,5464040," call them"
5464040,5464580," like this"
5464580,5465040," so"
5465040,5466980," pws"
5466980,5467820," right"
5467820,5468200," so"

5470120,5471000," lindra"
5471000,5471620," braga"
5471620,5474440," thank you"

5479520,5479900," thank you"
5479900,5480160," thank you"
5480160,5480500," thank you"
5480500,5481320," and welcome"

5482240,5482580," learning"
5482580,5482900," club"
5482900,5484660," yeah"
5484660,5485380," I hope"
5485380,5485580," it's"
5485580,5485900," interesting"
5485900,5486400," I'm actually"
5486400,5486780," having a"
5486780,5487000," blast"
5487000,5487480," I really"
5487480,5487900," enjoy what"
5487900,5488180," I'm doing"
5488180,5488680," right now"
5488680,5490300," maybe that's"
5490300,5490760," why a lot"
5490760,5491120," of people"
5491120,5491720," like doing"
5491720,5492040," machine"
5492040,5492380," learning"
5492380,5492780," because"
5492780,5493540," you just"
5493540,5494100," implement"
5494100,5494620," this"
5494620,5495160," magical"
5495160,5495600," model"
5495600,5496220," and it"
5496220,5496860," magically"
5496860,5497360," works"
5497360,5498420," and makes"
5498420,5498760," you feel"
5498760,5499080," like you're"
5499080,5499560," doing something"
5499560,5500020," important"
5500020,5500560," and something"
5500560,5500940," cool"
5500940,5502260," I guess"
5502260,5503440," because that's"
5503440,5503840," what I feel"
5503840,5504280," right now"
5504280,5505520," right because"
5505520,5506220," I couldn't"
5506220,5506720," come up with"
5506720,5507180," these formulas"
5507180,5507720," myself"
5507720,5508260," obviously"
5508260,5510100," but I just"
5510100,5510720," implement them"
5510720,5511280," and it"
5511280,5511980," feels cool"
5511980,5513400," nailed it"
5513400,5513640," okay"
5513640,5514860," that's the"
5514860,5515240," reason why"
5515240,5515680," people like"
5515680,5515800," it"
5515800,5515980," okay"
5515980,5516340," I see"
5516340,5517040," I can"
5517040,5517360," see the"
5517360,5517640," appeal"
5517640,5521040," right"
5521040,5521980," so"
5521980,5523340," yeah"
5523340,5523780," so"
5523780,5524920," PWS"
5524920,5526060," and PWH"
5526060,5527160," so the"
5527160,5527800," formula is"
5527800,5528680," PWS"
5528680,5529200," plus"
5529200,5529760," PWS"
5529760,5530240," plus"
5530240,5531680," PHS"
5531680,5532440," right"
5532440,5532820," and now"
5532820,5533200," we have to"
5533200,5533460," implement"
5533460,5533720," that"
5533720,5534720," so"
5534720,5534720," so"
5534720,5537340," PWS"
5537340,5538480," is"
5538480,5539040," equal"
5539040,5540500," word"
5540500,5541320," probability"
5541320,5542440," it's actually"
5542440,5542840," a word"
5542840,5543200," probability"
5543200,5543780," just word"
5543780,5544160," probability"
5544160,5544660," and that"
5544660,5545380," specific function"
5545380,5546100," takes a word"
5546100,5547260," and a bag of"
5547260,5547460," words"
5547460,5548040," in that case"
5548040,5548480," it's going to be"
5548480,5548760," spam"
5548760,5549400," so you see"
5549400,5549940," it's a probability"
5549940,5550820," for it being a"
5550820,5551100," spam"
5551100,5553000," and similarly"
5553000,5554240," similarly"
5554240,5555580," PHS"
5555580,5556460," is a word"
5556460,5556940," probability"
5556940,5558100," for"
5558100,5558680," ham"
5558680,5559280," bag of"
5559280,5559560," words"
5559560,5560860," there we go"
5560860,5562820," and I think"
5562820,5564460," that should be"
5564460,5567040," why is this"
5567040,5567500," so simple"
5567500,5567740," okay"
5567740,5568400," so"
5568400,5569520," I think"
5569520,5570180," that's literally"
5570180,5570460," it"
5570460,5571000," so"
5571000,5571520," we have"
5571520,5571820," all the"
5571820,5572220," statistics"
5572220,5572620," we just"
5572620,5572960," use the"
5572960,5573420," statistics"
5573420,5573960," and"
5573960,5574840," but this"
5574840,5575160," is only"
5575160,5575500," for a"
5575500,5575720," single"
5575720,5576120," word"
5576120,5577960," this is"
5577960,5578120," only"
5578120,5578460," for a"
5578460,5578660," single"
5578660,5578960," word"
5578960,5579860," okay"
5579860,5580380," so"
5580380,5581520," and"
5581520,5582100," oh"
5582100,5582800," god damn"
5582800,5583560," so here's"
5583560,5584100," the problem"
5584100,5587240," these"
5587240,5587740," things"
5587740,5588900," yeah"
5588900,5589560," these things"
5589560,5590320," they produce"
5590320,5591260," side effects"
5591260,5591720," because they"
5591720,5592180," had to be"
5592180,5592620," read at"
5592620,5592940," runtime"
5592940,5593460," so"
5593460,5595360," we have"
5595360,5595620," to do"
5595620,5595860," it like"
5595860,5596060," that"
5596060,5596640," unfortunately"
5596640,5598140," yeah"
5598140,5598620," it will"
5598620,5599560," return"
5599560,5600200," this"
5600200,5606780," well"
5606780,5607480," it is"
5607480,5607800," what it"
5607800,5608040," is"
5608040,5608380," and it"
5608380,5608820," isn't"
5608820,5609100," what it"
5609100,5609360," isn't"
5609360,5609700," so"
5609700,5610780," okay"
5610780,5611600," so we"
5611600,5612020," could try"
5612020,5612680," to read"
5612680,5613460," these files"
5613460,5614140," at compile"
5614140,5614520," time"

5615980,5617620," that would"
5617620,5618180," be cool"
5618180,5619380," imagine"
5619380,5620080," like this"
5620080,5620520," code"
5620520,5621160," executing"
5621160,5621760," at compile"
5621760,5622100," time"
5622100,5622380," and just"
5622380,5622740," returning"
5622740,5623280," like a"
5623280,5623860," bowl"
5623860,5625420," huh"
5625420,5627240," that would"
5627240,5627820," be interesting"
5627820,5629340," template"
5629340,5629740," haskell"
5629740,5629880," is"
5629880,5630060," per"
5630060,5630380," evil"
5630380,5631100," well I"
5631100,5631300," mean"
5631300,5631820," it's"
5631820,5632220," kind of"
5632220,5632520," cool"
5632520,5633120," like it's"
5633120,5633380," literally"
5633380,5634100," like macros"
5634100,5634680," but it's"
5634680,5634960," not just"
5634960,5635400," macros"
5635400,5635900," they enable"
5635900,5636400," you with"
5636400,5637400," executing"
5637400,5638160," like arbitrary"
5638160,5638640," code"
5638640,5639240," at compile"
5639240,5639680," time"
5639680,5644760," and that"
5644760,5644900," and that is"
5644900,5645360," cool"
5645360,5646840," I'm not"
5646840,5647400," gonna lie"
5647400,5650720," but I'm"
5650720,5651000," not sure"
5651000,5651840," if I know"
5651840,5652220," enough"
5652220,5652540," template"
5652540,5652960," haskell"
5652960,5653780," to pull"
5653780,5654340," that off"
5654340,5657280," okay"
5657280,5658060," so we're"
5658060,5658380," gonna move"
5658380,5659080," this stuff"
5659080,5659300," here"
5659300,5659680," maybe at"
5659680,5660060," some point"
5660060,5660400," I'm gonna"
5660400,5661700," you know"
5661700,5662020," make it"
5662020,5662320," compile"
5662320,5663660," so if I'm"
5663660,5663920," gonna use"
5663920,5664200," template"
5664200,5664660," haskell"
5664660,5665300," I will"
5665300,5665840," essentially"
5665840,5666860," bake the"
5666860,5667380," data"
5667380,5668540," into the"
5668540,5669120," executable"
5669120,5670400," which will"
5670400,5671920," help me to"
5671920,5672300," get rid of"
5672300,5672540," IO"
5672540,5673160," but I mean"
5673160,5674500," I'm not sure"
5674500,5674980," how useful"
5674980,5675500," it would be"
5675500,5677000," okay"
5677000,5678940," so here's that"
5678940,5680080," and one of the"
5680080,5680640," things I'll have"
5680640,5680860," to do"
5680860,5681320," I'll have to"
5681320,5681960," penetrate all"
5681960,5682280," this"
5682280,5683340," and then return"
5683340,5683980," all this"
5683980,5684740," and there we go"
5684740,5685260," I think this is"
5685260,5685740," how we can do"
5685740,5685900," that"
5685900,5686520," and it compiles"
5686520,5687240," okay so I just"
5687240,5688760," restructured my code"
5688760,5689380," and that's"
5689380,5689800," what it is"
5689800,5691200," it will always"
5691200,5692540," produce side effects"
5692540,5692960," and stuff"
5692960,5693580," even though it"
5693580,5694680," shouldn't"
5694680,5697860," yeah because"
5697860,5698920," this thing"
5698920,5700440," should just"
5700440,5701240," accept two"
5701240,5702460," bag of words"
5702460,5702740," right"
5702740,5703700," to be fair"
5703700,5704200," if you think"
5704200,5704560," about it"
5704560,5705060," it just should"
5705060,5705600," accept two"
5705600,5706240," bag of words"
5706240,5708020," but whatever"
5708020,5709740," word probability"
5709740,5711400," word probability"
5711400,5711760," spam"
5711760,5712080," okay"
5712080,5713160," so we implemented"
5713160,5714540," so if"
5714540,5715620," the message"
5715620,5716540," contains"
5716540,5717020," word"
5717020,5717500," hello"
5717500,5718780," what's the"
5718780,5719200," probability"
5719200,5719700," of that"
5719700,5720020," message"
5720020,5720520," being a"
5720520,5720780," spam"
5720780,5728500," okay"
5728500,5729520," that's very"
5729520,5729960," interesting"
5729960,5734340," what about"
5734340,5735020," world"
5735020,5736240," one"
5736240,5738080," test"
5738080,5739220," zero"
5739220,5742220," yeah"
5742220,5743320," huh"
5743320,5745440," this thing"
5745440,5745960," is zero"
5745960,5746400," none"
5746400,5748140," oh"
5748140,5749020," it's in case"
5749020,5749500," yeah"
5749500,5750180," when both"
5750180,5750540," of them"
5750540,5751200," are zero"
5751200,5752980," yeah"
5752980,5753820," what if"
5753820,5754360," both of"
5754360,5754540," them"
5754540,5755120," are zero"
5755120,5755460," okay"
5755460,5755920," this is"
5755920,5756140," very"
5756140,5756560," interesting"
5756560,5757660," yeah"
5757660,5758120," when both"
5758120,5758340," of them"
5758340,5758640," are zero"
5758640,5759140," you basically"
5759140,5759760," have division"
5759760,5760180," by"
5760180,5761780," division"
5761780,5762320," by zero"
5762320,5772940," hello"
5772940,5773420," and"
5773420,5773820," haskell"
5773820,5774140," also"
5774140,5774660," will give us"
5774660,5774940," none"
5774940,5775480," so basically"
5775480,5776060," it's a word"
5776060,5776800," that we've never"
5776800,5777480," seen before"
5777480,5778340," food"
5778340,5780840," hat"
5780840,5783980," okay"
5783980,5785840," okay"
5785840,5785880," okay"
5785880,5786480," I'm"
5786480,5786840," an engineer"
5786840,5787200," myself"
5787200,5787760," in the company"
5787760,5788320," work on"
5788320,5788640," moved"
5788640,5789640," from hiring"
5789640,5790320," statisticians"
5790320,5790760," to software"
5790760,5791060," engineers"
5791060,5791600," that's because"
5791600,5792180," in the end"
5792180,5792940," in production"
5792940,5793580," the most difficult"
5793580,5794200," problem are"
5794200,5794600," the ones"
5794600,5795060," that software"
5795060,5795420," engineers"
5795420,5796020," already know"
5796020,5796760," how to solve"
5796760,5797960," cloud infrastructure"
5797960,5798440," monitoring"
5798440,5798840," version"
5798840,5799240," deploying"
5799240,5799720," the machine"
5799720,5800240," learning part"
5800240,5800780," is not that"
5800780,5801300," difficult to"
5801300,5801560," grasp"
5801560,5801840," for a"
5801840,5802120," programmer"
5802120,5802800," yeah"
5802800,5803460," this is"
5803460,5803660," something"
5803660,5803940," that I"
5803940,5804120," heard"
5804120,5804440," about"
5804440,5805240," right"
5805240,5805800," it's just"
5805800,5806280," more important"
5806280,5806660," to have"
5806660,5807120," the software"
5807120,5807460," engineering"
5807460,5807900," skills"
5807900,5808220," than"
5808220,5809040," math"
5809040,5809460," skills"
5809460,5809900," because"
5809900,5811160," yeah"
5811160,5812660," a specific"
5812660,5813080," math"
5813080,5814600," for a developer"
5814600,5815340," for software"
5815340,5815620," engineering"
5815620,5816080," is not that"
5816080,5816360," difficult"
5816360,5816660," to grasp"
5816660,5816900," because"
5816900,5817860," they have"
5817860,5818160," to"
5818160,5819300," work"
5819300,5819940," with"
5819940,5820500," several"

5821000,5821500," of math"
5821500,5822140," simultaneously"
5822140,5822540," anyway"
5822540,5822880," so"
5822880,5823520," programmers"
5823520,5823920," kind of"
5823920,5824280," usually"
5824280,5825660," used to"
5825660,5825880," math"
5825880,5826280," anyway"
5826280,5828460," huskik"
5828460,5828840," is back"
5828840,5829020," to"
5829020,5829360," sorting"
5829360,5829680," stream"
5829680,5830180," I mean"
5830180,5830560," it was"
5830560,5830920," never"
5830920,5831820," gone"
5831820,5832060," from"
5832060,5832320," sorting"
5832320,5832720," streams"
5832720,5833080," it was"
5833080,5833340," just"
5833340,5833740," you know"
5833740,5834500," I just"
5834500,5834740," stopped"
5834740,5835320," developing"
5835320,5835560," the"
5835560,5835760," bottom"
5835760,5835940," of"
5835940,5835980," the"
5835980,5836240," streams"
5836240,5837400," so"
5837400,5838020," but"
5838020,5838220," I"
5838220,5838660," program"
5838660,5838840," in"
5838840,5839140," Haskell"
5839140,5839280," on"
5839280,5839400," this"
5839400,5839620," channel"
5839620,5839840," from"
5839840,5840040," time"
5840040,5840160," to"
5840160,5840380," time"
5840380,5840800," so"
5840800,5841760," it's"
5841760,5842320," totally"
5842320,5842640," fine"
5842640,5843680," okay"
5843680,5844180," so"
5844180,5845440," I suppose"
5845440,5846040," if both"
5846040,5846360," of the"

5846860,5847620," return"
5847620,5848060," zero"
5848060,5848500," right"
5848500,5849020," if both"
5849020,5849300," of them"
5849300,5849640," return"
5849640,5850000," zero"
5850000,5851860," what"
5851860,5852040," should"
5852040,5852180," we"
5852180,5852380," do"
5852380,5853440," the"
5853440,5853900," probability"
5853900,5854500," of it"
5854500,5854900," is"
5854900,5855480," essentially"
5855480,5855920," zero"
5855920,5856340," right"
5856340,5858040," what if"
5858040,5858260," it's"
5858260,5858660," zero"
5858660,5873480," and"
5873480,5874000," oh"
5874000,5874220," yeah"
5874220,5874400," and"
5874400,5874600," we're"
5874600,5874860," also"
5874860,5875520," the"
5875520,5875880," final"
5875880,5876100," is"
5876100,5876240," going"
5876240,5876300," to"
5876300,5876460," be"
5876460,5876820," that"
5876820,5878040," so"
5878040,5878220," I'm"
5878220,5878420," just"
5878420,5878620," thinking"
5878620,5878840," how"
5878840,5878980," to"
5878980,5879200," handle"
5879200,5879460," that"
5879460,5880320," we"
5880320,5880480," can"
5880480,5880760," simply"
5880760,5881000," try"
5881000,5881120," to"
5881120,5881280," do"
5881280,5881500," something"
5881500,5881720," like"
5881720,5882020," this"
5882020,5883800," so"
5883800,5884000," we're"
5884000,5884100," going to"
5884100,5884300," have"
5884300,5884660," piece"
5884660,5884960," sum"
5884960,5886280," so"
5886280,5886460," this"
5886460,5886580," is"
5886580,5886720," a"
5886720,5886940," piece"
5886940,5887200," sum"
5887200,5888200," and"
5888200,5889340," we"
5889340,5889460," can"
5889460,5889620," just"
5889620,5889780," have"

6287420,6287860," stream"
6287860,6289000," all right"
6289000,6289360," so"
6289360,6290360," we're already"
6290360,6290860," starting to"
6290860,6291520," have problems"
6291520,6292600," like specifically"
6292600,6293240," here"
6293240,6293980," I think"
6293980,6299900," because"
6299900,6300400," because I think"
6300400,6301160," word probability"
6301160,6301940," works"
6301940,6302640," really"
6302640,6302860," really"
6302860,6303360," strange"
6303360,6304760," so if"
6304760,6304920," it's"
6304920,6305400," a test"
6305400,6305940," it's"
6305940,6306400," zero"
6306400,6307360," hello"
6307360,6308720," it's that"
6308720,6309280," and it's"
6309280,6310000," never really"
6310000,6312660," anything in"
6312660,6313060," between"
6313060,6313640," like it's"
6313640,6314280," really strange"
6314280,6315300," so if I"
6315300,6316100," try to check"
6316100,6316660," that word"
6316660,6317060," in a"
6317060,6317480," spam"
6317480,6320680," thingy"
6320680,6321680," so like"
6321680,6322460," like this"
6322460,6322460," so like this"
6322460,6324140," this is the probability"
6324140,6325480," this is the actual probability"
6325480,6326180," in the spam"
6326180,6327360," so if"
6327360,6328180," think of spam"
6328180,6329080," this is the probability"
6329080,6330220," of having these words"
6330220,6332220," but if it's a"
6332220,6332560," ham"
6332560,6334420," it's zero"
6334420,6335420," and hello"
6335420,6337020," is also zero"
6337020,6338340," because we never have"
6338340,6339180," hello there"
6339180,6340680," but maybe this is because"
6340680,6341960," I never really"
6341960,6342860," properly"
6342860,6344460," normalize the words"
6344460,6345580," that's probably"
6345580,6346180," the thing"
6346180,6347540," yeah"
6347540,6348560," so"
6348560,6350240," yeah"
6350240,6350980," so I think"
6350980,6352140," I just never properly"
6352140,6352880," normalize the word"
6352880,6354200," let's try to normalize"
6354200,6354500," them"
6354500,6355740," yeah"
6355740,6358040," so we need to have"
6358040,6359000," some sort of function"
6359000,6360240," sentence"
6360240,6361320," send"
6361320,6363160," like text"
6363160,6364600," maybe"
6364600,6366120," normalize"
6366120,6366920," text"
6366920,6368900," two"
6368900,6369680," words"
6369680,6373580," so"
6373580,6374180," and"
6374180,6375060," it's going to accept"
6375060,6375580," the text"
6375580,6376680," and it will return"
6376680,6377840," you normalized words"
6377840,6378820," and I think we already"
6378820,6379760," did something like that"
6379760,6380180," before"
6380180,6381040," right"
6381040,6383100," I think we already"
6383100,6383940," did something like that"
6383940,6384180," before"
6384180,6385060," I need something"
6385060,6386160," with"
6386160,6388200," punctuation marks"
6388200,6394560," so"
6394560,6395120," something"
6395120,6396880," we do"
6396880,6397400," have"
6397400,6399780," whatever"
6399780,6401020," whatever that is"
6401020,6403860," yeah"
6403860,6405100," so"
6405100,6405740," essentially"
6405740,6407340," I want to"
6407340,6407980," first"
6407980,6408780," remove"
6408780,6409800," all of these things"
6409800,6410420," that are not"
6410420,6411120," alphanumeric"
6411120,6411860," I know that it's"
6411860,6412400," kind of dumb"
6412400,6413660," but this is"
6413660,6414740," educational project"
6414740,6415020," okay"
6415020,6415840," so"
6415840,6416740," this is going to be"
6416740,6418080," text map"
6418080,6418780," and"
6418780,6420720," if"
6420720,6423780," I will need"
6423780,6424480," to import"
6424480,6425440," data char"
6425440,6426440," so"
6426440,6426900," we'll need"
6426900,6427460," data char"
6427460,6427840," here"
6427840,6428700," that's for sure"
6428700,6429040," because"
6429040,6430060," how else"
6430060,6430360," can I"
6430360,6431200," classify"
6431200,6432120," characters"
6432120,6434280," incorrect"
6434280,6435200," indentation"
6435200,6437920," okay"
6437920,6439020," so"
6439020,6439820," if"
6439820,6442880," is"
6442880,6443600," alpha"
6443600,6444820," num"
6444820,6446900," then"
6446900,6447480," I return"
6447480,6448040," this thing"
6448040,6448520," otherwise"
6448520,6449320," I replace"
6449320,6449760," it with"
6449760,6450360," space"
6450360,6452160," like"
6452160,6452540," this"
6452540,6453240," so"
6453240,6453460," this"
6453460,6453580," is"
6453580,6453720," the"
6453720,6453900," first"
6453900,6454080," thing"
6454080,6454280," we're"
6454280,6454460," going to"
6454460,6454600," do"
6454600,6455020," we get"
6455020,6455480," rid of"
6455480,6455780," all of"
6455780,6455920," these"
6455920,6456140," things"
6456140,6456360," and"
6456360,6456500," then"
6456500,6456680," we"
6456680,6456920," split"

6888780,6889140," this"
6889140,6889660," so"
6889660,6890120," low"
6890120,6896240," hello"
6896240,6897360," pmqmg"
6897360,6899180," so"
6899180,6899700," maybe"
6899700,6900580," my"
6900580,6900960," way"
6900960,6901380," of"
6901380,6901740," computing"
6901740,6902280," probability"

6903900,6904160," not"
6904160,6904640," particularly"
6904640,6905320," correct"
6905320,6906560," I"
6906560,6906720," don't"
6906720,6906920," think"
6906920,6907100," it's"
6907100,6907480," particularly"
6907480,6908000," correct"
6908000,6912540," all right"
6912540,6913740," so"
6913740,6916960," because"
6916960,6917800," the probability"
6917800,6918260," of that"
6918260,6918540," word"
6918540,6918980," should be"
6918980,6919360," actually"
6919360,6919840," huge"
6919840,6920200," is it"
6920200,6920440," not"
6920440,6921360," I think"
6921360,6921820," I think"
6921820,6922380," like because"
6922380,6922740," yeah"
6922740,6923840," probably because"
6923840,6924720," the sum"
6924720,6925160," of all"
6925160,6925400," of these"
6925400,6925760," numbers"
6925760,6926240," is too"
6926240,6926600," huge"
6926600,6927120," so"
6927120,6927620," there"
6927620,6928000," doesn't"
6928000,6928180," really"
6928180,6928540," appear"
6928540,6928980," that"
6928980,6930620," probable"
6930620,6930980," but"
6930980,6931840," it does"
6931840,6932340," make sense"
6932340,6932740," maybe we"
6932740,6933220," just need"
6933220,6933660," more"
6933660,6934200," data"
6934200,6935500," yeah"
6935500,6935780," it feels"
6935780,6936060," like we"
6936060,6936520," just don't"
6936520,6937160," have enough"
6937160,6937500," data"
6937500,6937780," maybe"
6937780,6938140," for"
6938140,6938620," it"
6938620,6938760," to"
6938760,6939100," properly"
6939100,6939960," kick in"
6939960,6944140," so"
6944140,6945680," when we"
6945680,6946440," sum up"
6946440,6946760," all of"
6946760,6947220," the words"

6947880,6951000," count"
6951000,6951500," right"
6951500,6952040," so"
6952040,6953160," we take"
6953160,6953620," the list"
6953620,6954380," right"
6954380,6954860," we convert it"
6954860,6955300," to the list"
6955300,6955980," we take"
6955980,6956380," the second"
6956380,6960360," the number"
6960360,6961020," is low"
6961020,6961360," but"
6961360,6961980," the value"
6961980,6962540," is"
6962540,6964040," the highest"
6964040,6964860," for words"
6964860,6965300," in that"
6965300,6965680," bag"
6965680,6966220," and"
6966220,6966740," yeah"
6966740,6967240," the number"
6967240,6967700," it is"
6967700,6969840," okay"
6969840,6970260," so"
6970260,6970740," and"
6970740,6971300," then"
6971300,6971700," we sum"
6971700,6972000," it up"
6972000,6972200," okay"
6972200,6972360," so"
6972360,6972580," I don't"

7502220,7502340," been"
7502340,7502580," like"
7502580,7502940," programming"
7502940,7503200," like"
7503200,7503720," two hours"
7503720,7504200," non-stop"
7504200,7507160," okay"
7507160,7509700," all right"
7509700,7510140," let's make"
7510140,7510340," a small"
7510340,7510520," break"
7510520,7510740," and you"
7510740,7510980," guys"
7510980,7511280," have"
7511280,7511500," fun"
7534200,7535200," like"
7535200,7535200," I'm"
7535200,7535200," like"
7535200,7536200," I'm"
7536200,7537200," like"
7537200,7537200," I'm"
7537200,7537200," like"
7537200,7538200," I'm"
7538200,7539200," like"
7539200,7569180," Thank you."
7569200,7599180," Thank you."
7599200,7629180," Thank you."
7629200,7659180," Thank you."
7659200,7689180," Thank you."
7689180,7689720," What's up?"
7689720,7690700," Welcome back."
7690700,7692000," How everyone's doing?"
7692000,7696200," Let's continue doing machine learning."
7696200,7697180," How about that?"
7699560,7703860," Well, I mean, it's a, it was a cutting edge technology 20 years ago."
7703860,7720880," Anyways, so, um, the problem is that, I mean, that's, that's the main problem."
7721740,7725600," Um, and I'm not sure if, um, and I'm not sure if, uh, like hiding word will help."
7725600,7729820," Uh, can I call this thing a word prime?"
7729820,7732040," Is that a thing I can do?"
7732040,7733940," Just call it word prime."
7735540,7738800," Uh, I think I can, uh, I think I can, I think that's, that's the thing I can do."
7738800,7741600," Uh, yep."
7741600,7745480," Yep."
7745480,7752780," Because in my brain, I already build a mental model and in that mental model, it is already"
7752780,7753400," called word."
7753940,7755620," And there's nothing I can do about that."
7755620,7758820," Like, nope, there's nothing I can do about that."
7758820,7762080," Um, so word prime."
7762080,7764680," I just need to use word, uh, word, word."
7764680,7767840," Otherwise I won't be able to work on my code base."
7768840,7770020," It's just too late."
7770020,7771800," It's simply too late."
7771800,7773440," And we're supposed to return word prime."
7773440,7777560," Uh, so in here I can just do this."
7777560,7779440," Make word."
7779440,7782560," Hmm."
7782560,7783540," Okay."
7783540,7785020," Is it going to work now?"
7785020,7787580," Uh, bow to map."
7787580,7788600," Uh, all right."
7788600,7792040," So here we have to accept, uh, word."
7792040,7793760," There we go."
7793760,7795900," Uh, do we have anything else?"
7795900,7797780," This is also word."
7798840,7804580," Uh, and the only way you can create the word is by using function that also automatically"
7804580,7805660," normalizes it."
7805660,7809660," Print word because it's not printable."
7809660,7811580," Well, okay."
7811580,7816180," I think in that particular case, we can try to unwrap it, but we should never actually wrap"
7816180,7816380," it."
7816380,7817060," Yeah."
7817060,7819880," We should never, uh, wrap it."
7819880,7821140," You know what?"
7821140,7827200," Let's implement the function, um, word to text."
7827720,7829140," Or maybe, no, no, no."
7829140,7830160," I think it would be okay."
7830160,7831300," So word."
7831300,7840200," Text is going to be essentially word."
7840200,7845520," It returns the text, uh, or prime, of course."
7845520,7846900," Okay."
7847000,7851360," And here we can do word to text."
7851360,7858840," So I'm essentially exploiting the type system to help me to check that I always normalize"
7858840,7861400," the words, uh, when I'm working with them."
7861400,7861720," Right."
7861720,7867440," So since like word is a completely separate type and the only way you can construct a word"
7867440,7868740," is by calling this function."
7868740,7873080," And that function always normalizes it, uh, calling to upper, right?"
7873080,7879780," Or if you have a text, uh, you always have to, uh, call this function, normalize text to words."
7879780,7881880," Um, yeah."
7884700,7889100," So, um, okay."
7889100,7890980," Uh, what do we have here?"
7890980,7895960," Uh, so I can try to check the, uh, but this is not how it works anymore."
7895960,7900860," You have to, uh, use make word, uh, make word like this."
7900860,7901920," And that's the probability."
7901920,7904580," And it doesn't matter how exactly you spell it."
7904580,7906960," It always normalizes it and stuff like that."
7906960,7907160," Cool."
7908240,7911900," Um, so let me see what we've done so far."
7911900,7914140," Uh, do we have anything to commit right now?"
7914140,7915940," I think we have something to commit right now."
7915940,7918120," Uh, yeah."
7918120,7928320," First, um, first implementation of, uh, of the classifier."
7928320,7930440," I'm going to push that right into the repo."
7930440,7931760," It's probably very buggy."
7931760,7935020," You can always do word, uh, some text."
7935020,7938160," Well, you can, uh,"
7938240,7939860," but I'm doing that for myself."
7939860,7945320," Yes."
7945320,7947680," It should be in separate module, in a hidden,"
7947680,7949000," but I'm doing that for myself."
7949000,7950500," Actually, spill water yet again."
7950500,7951480," Right."
7951480,7953960," So, uh, in that case, it doesn't matter."
7953960,7954880," All right."
7954880,7958360," I just applied this policy that for that specific type,"
7958360,7960560," I only constructed through this function."
7960560,7963740," So, and that helps me, not anyone else,"
7963740,7966080," me to not make a mistake in the future."
7966080,7967000," Right."
7968240,7969620," Uh, all right."
7969620,7972720," Maybe later, um, I'm going to maybe separate the module,"
7972720,7976160," but right now, once, since the code is not finished yet,"
7976160,7977920," the code is not finished yet, it doesn't work."
7977920,7979220," It doesn't matter."
7979220,7982200," Uh, so it's just a small helper."
7982900,7984060," Um, no."
7984060,7989000," Okay."
7989000,7993140," So, we need to implement a function that checks whether we've seen that word before."
7993140,7994320," Right."
7996380,8006080," Uh, um, so how I'm going to call it scene, um, scene word."
8006080,8011760," Uh, we're going to accept the word prime, uh, and it's going to return boolean."
8011760,8014600," Is the code ever finished?"
8014680,8014880," Yes."
8014880,8014900," Yes."
8014900,8017980," So, um, what do we do?"
8017980,8020700," Um, we look up."
8020700,8025900," Um, look up."
8025900,8029320," Uh, that word."
8030900,8045140," In, uh, the spam poll, and that gives us a boolean, not boolean, maybe, uh, s maybe, ham maybe, and this is going to be a ham."
8045940,8058620," So, and if this is true, if, um, is just a sem, or is just a chem."
8058620,8059920," Cool."
8059920,8064340," So, that's exactly what we, what we have here."
8064340,8065180," Is it going to compile?"
8065180,8066460," It's not going to compile."
8066460,8067880," Because why?"
8067880,8069460," Uh, show me the error."
8069460,8073700," Yeah, because we have to convert all of that."
8073700,8080600," So, it has to be something like boolean to map, to map, and it works."
8080600,8081140," Cool."
8081140,8083320," So, we can check the following thing."
8083320,8084720," Uh, scene word."
8084720,8089040," Scene, uh, word."
8089040,8097240," So, and we have to do make word test."
8097240,8099820," Uh, we've seen that word before."
8099820,8101020," Have we seen that word before?"
8101020,8102660," Have we seen that word before?"
8102900,8104140," We've never seen that word before."
8104140,8105100," Cool."
8105100,8107440," So, now we can easily check all of that."
8107440,8112800," I don't really like how I made two, like, global bag of words."
8112800,8117760," And, uh, I make functions that depend on this global bag of words."
8117760,8121120," And that forces all of these functions to be side effect-ish."
8121120,8122600," It kind of ruins everything."
8122600,8127520," So, maybe what I'm going to do, I'm going to try to refactor all of that."
8128020,8136280," Um, and, uh, make all of these functions accept this bag of words instead of depending on the global ones."
8136280,8137760," Hello, LizzieGrid."
8137760,8138540," Welcome to the stream."
8138540,8141320," Um, welcome, welcome, welcome."
8143820,8144560," Uh, yeah."
8144560,8145860," Check out the hair command."
8145860,8148640," Check out the hair command."
8148640,8153000," I'm really sorry if that upsets you, but it is what it is."
8153000,8154460," And it isn't what it isn't."
8155640,8159980," It's just too much effort for me, and I just don't have time for that."
8159980,8162100," I just don't have time for that."
8162100,8162600," I'm sorry."
8162600,8165120," I'm a very lazy person."
8165120,8168520," Uh, okay."
8170000,8173680," I wish I had enough time to actually take care of my look, but I just don't."
8173680,8175220," Um, okay."
8175220,8176600," So, let's do a little bit of refactoring."
8176600,8185160," As a matter of fact, I want to introduce something like, uh, a data structure called spam classifier."
8185160,8187500," Uh, classifier."
8187500,8188640," Right."
8188640,8192620," Um, and it's too long, actually."
8192620,8194480," Can we have something, like, shorter?"
8195200,8197340," Looks like a bold man for brothers."
8197340,8200860," Doesn't sound like something bad, to be fair."
8200860,8201740," I don't know."
8201740,8204300," I mean, that's the..."
8204300,8205100," Sounds pretty good."
8205100,8209620," All right."
8209620,8213000," So, I need a name for this thing."
8213000,8217220," And this thing will contain, uh, a spam bowl."
8217220,8219460," Uh, a spam bowl."
8219460,8222400," Bag of words, I mean."
8222400,8224060," And a hand bowl."
8225200,8233020," Uh, I would like, uh, I would look like a testicle if I went bold."
8233020,8234280," Hmm, interesting."
8234280,8241680," Yeah, surprisingly, the shape of my head is actually okay for being bold, I suppose."
8241680,8242060," Maybe."
8242060,8243160," I don't know."
8243160,8248320," Um, oh my god."
8248320,8248940," Cool."
8248940,8252020," It looks five heads."
8252020,8254040," Hmm, nice."
8254040,8258580," Uh, so, spam classifier."
8258580,8261160," So, I wish we had, like, a..."
8261160,8263120," Smaller name."
8263120,8267540," Um..."
8267540,8271540," Spam..."
8271540,8272620," Uh, oh my god."
8272620,8273060," Emacs!"
8273060,8273860," Emacs, please!"
8273860,8277200," Uh, spam filter."
8277200,8280880," It could be spam filter."
8280880,8281600," Why not?"
8281600,8286420," And, uh, then we can have something like spam filter."
8286420,8292000," Uh, which depends on these things, right?"
8292000,8292960," So..."
8292960,8299920," Um, now he feels every blow of the wind."
8302120,8304740," Um, is army monitor in Russia?"
8304740,8305160," Yes."
8305160,8305740," Um..."
8305740,8307740," Um..."
8307740,8308740," Um..."
8308740,8309920," Okay."
8309920,8312840," Spam."
8312840,8318620," So, this is what we'll have to do."
8318620,8320040," Like this."
8321220,8322920," And, uh, ham."
8322920,8325060," Then we can remove all of this."
8325060,8327840," And then we can return..."
8327840,8330240," Uh, spam filter."
8330240,8331940," Spam and ham."
8331940,8333080," There we go."
8333080,8336740," So, and now, we don't really have to do any of this stuff."
8336740,8339980," We can just essentially accept the spam filter."
8339980,8342880," Spam filter and word."
8343260,8345340," Yeah, and get rid of this IO completely."
8345340,8350240," So, uh, spam filter."
8350240,8352180," Uh, spam bowl."
8352180,8353440," Ham bowl."
8353440,8359460," I have a scar on the back of my head."
8359460,8361700," So, going bald isn't the best option for me."
8361700,8362240," Oh."
8362240,8363620," I see."
8363620,8367120," But maybe it will make you look even more brutal."
8367120,8368240," I don't know."
8368240,8370400," Pure spam filter."
8370400,8372440," Yeah, it is going to be pure spam filter."
8373260,8373980," All right."
8373980,8375840," So, and this is what we're going to have here."
8375840,8376900," So, it's going to be a let."
8376900,8378780," Uh, finally."
8378780,8381240," It's going to be pure."
8381240,8385880," You should get air-banded tattoos."
8385880,8392040," I'm not a big fan of tattoos or piercing or any, like, body modification, to be fair."
8392040,8396660," Uh, so, I'm probably not going to do that for me."
8396660,8397420," Sorry."
8397420,8399900," Um, mm-hmm."
8403260,8413660," Now, um, might look at that, but it depends on the, uh, on the scar and how the person themselves"
8413660,8416660," usually feel comfortable or not comfortable showing that scar."
8416660,8417000," Yeah."
8417960,8419560," Uh, what are you creating?"
8419560,8426920," I'm creating a spam filter in, in Haskell using naive, uh, base, naive base classifier."
8426920,8427720," That's what I'm using."
8427720,8429420," Um, all right."
8429800,8434600," So, uh, here's the ball and that means we'll have to do a ball to Jean."
8434600,8435000," Hello."
8435000,8436520," Uh, welcome."
8436520,8441480," Well, yeah, maybe painting like, uh, like arrow will be, will be okay."
8441480,8446460," Just temporarily, uh, ball to map."
8447240,8449260," So, uh, we'll already do that here."
8449260,8451000," Uh, we'll already do that here."
8451000,8452620," And then I just look it up."
8452620,8454460," Uh-huh."
8454460,8455920," Come on."
8455920,8457540," Just look it up."
8457540,8458860," And this is what I have to return."
8458860,8462460," So, look at that pure, pure code."
8462460,8465000," The purest of the code."
8465000,8468720," This is as pure, Jesus fucking Christ."
8468720,8469040," Okay."
8469040,8470840," I've got a, I've got a message."
8471020,8471800," You've got mail."
8471800,8473540," I'm pretty sure it's a spam."
8473540,8477500," I can use a spam classifier to detect whether this is a spam or not."
8477500,8480440," Uh, yes, it is spam."
8480440,8481560," Everything's okay."
8481560,8483760," Look at that pure code."
8483760,8484540," Look at that."
8484540,8485700," Isn't that beautiful?"
8485700,8487040," I think it's goddamn beautiful."
8487040,8487440," Okay."
8487440,8490180," So, we also need to do a similar thing here."
8490180,8492060," So, spam filter."
8492060,8495620," Oh, you know, I, I think I came up with a good name for the spam filter."
8495620,8496500," Spam model."
8496500,8499660," Spam filter, spam model."
8499780,8501900," It's a little bit shorter and it actually makes sense."
8501900,8503660," Cool, cool, cool."
8503660,8507400," And, uh, this entire thing also should be called like this."
8507400,8508120," Something like this."
8508120,8510620," Uh, spam model."
8510620,8512120," Is that cool?"
8512120,8513820," Mm-hmm."
8513820,8522080," Oh, and, but, I'm going to, since we're going to apply all of these functions, yeah, I think"
8522080,8524180," we'll have to swap the arguments."
8524180,8529760," Yeah, because I'm going to partially apply this stuff, uh, all the time."
8529780,8533940," Yeah, since it's going to be partially applied all the time, it makes sense to actually do"
8533940,8534300," like that."
8534300,8535240," All right."
8535240,8537740," So, and here, we're going to accept the word."
8537740,8540200," And here is the, uh, word probability."
8540200,8542620," So, the probability of that word being spam."
8542620,8543660," That's what it is."
8544080,8548120," So, then we have a spam model, uh, spam ball."
8548120,8551460," Oh, shit, by the way, we might as well actually do the following thing."
8551460,8558280," Look, we can destructurize it even further, even further destructurization and which enables"
8558280,8560380," us with, oh my God."
8560380,8564380," Emacs, please, please Emacs."
8564380,8565440," Thank you very much."
8565500,8566760," Okay, this is what I was talking about."
8566760,8567880," Okay."
8567880,8573700," Which country in Europe would you choose to move at if you had to move?"
8573700,8578580," I'm actually having second thoughts on moving, to be fair."
8578580,8579380," I don't know."
8581300,8582920," No, the gore, thank you."
8582920,8585820," Thank you so much for looking good."
8585820,8586800," Thank you."
8586800,8592220," Thank you so much for nine months and for kind words, uh, tier one subscription, nine months."
8592220,8592800," That's epic."
8592800,8593240," Thank you."
8593240,8593520," Thank you."
8593520,8593860," Thank you."
8593860,8598820," And welcome to our amazing, legendary machine learning club."
8598820,8601620," We're doing, uh, spam filter in Haskell."
8601620,8603320," So it's pretty, it's pretty cool."
8603320,8606820," Uh, I'm surprised that the probability is per word."
8606820,8610380," I'd imagine the entire message would be flagged based on the entire content."
8610380,8612780," I mean, it is based on the entire content."
8612780,8617240," We need, we have a separate function that calculates a probability for the single word."
8617240,8620620," Then we go through all of the words and we multiply their probability,"
8620620,8622380," uh, probabilities according to the formula."
8622380,8625420," And this is how we get the probability of the whole message."
8625420,8628540," So yeah, that's how it works."
8628540,8629680," As far as I can understand."
8629680,8637580," Um, all righty."
8639460,8642200," And here is an interesting thing."
8642200,8649100," Um, so we should return float, but we should return maybe float because if we've never seen"
8649100,8655340," that word before, never seen that word before, uh, we cannot, uh, tell its probability to be"
8655340,8656860," in a spam at all."
8657860,8663640," But jokes aside, I'm from country where people, uh, made big, uh, fake scars because, uh, one single bit."
8663640,8669540," Hmm."
8671460,8671820," Okay."
8671820,8672920," That sounds scary."
8672920,8673820," Okay."
8673820,8678640," Very interesting."
8678640,8681880," KGB is coming."
8681880,8683820," They're coming for me."
8683820,8685980," All right."
8685980,8687640," So, yeah."
8687640,8688560," How are we going to do that?"
8688560,8691340," Um, so we have a particular word, right?"
8691440,8696080," And we can check whether we, uh, whether we've seen that word before or not."
8696080,8697720," Uh, that's how we're going to do that."
8697720,8700360," Uh, seen word w."
8700360,8703460," If we've seen that word, we're going to do this stuff."
8703460,8711100," If we've never seen that word before, uh, otherwise, I'm going to just return nothing."
8712100,8718080," And, uh, then when we use this entire function, when we're mapping everything, um, I'm going"
8718080,8724580," to take that into account and, uh, remove, um, the word's probability of spam, for which"
8724580,8725800," we just simply don't know."
8725800,8727160," All right."
8727160,8729920," So, word probability of this being a spam."
8729920,8730480," Okay."
8730480,8732300," So this is where I can use where."
8732300,8736720," I'm still waiting for Rambo."
8736720,8739020," Ha ha ha ha."
8739020,8740660," Cup of pride."
8742100,8745620," And by fake, I didn't mean, uh, painted or something, just not natural."
8745620,8747040," Oh, shit."
8747040,8747980," That's very brutal."
8747980,8750220," Uh."
8750220,8756020," Hmm."
8756020,8761960," Okay, cool."
8761960,8768660," So, and since all of that is pure, we don't need any of this stuff."
8768660,8769940," Uh, yeah."
8771400,8774400," Haskell definitely encourages you to write more pure code."
8774400,8776420," Imperial code is just pain in the ass to write."
8776420,8780040," And that's, that's a reasonable, I suppose."
8780040,8783320," Um, that's really reasonable."
8783320,8793340," And because, and because we have, um, seen that word, I think that value should never become"
8793340,8793700," none."
8794100,8796460," Um, I'm pretty sure about that, right?"
8796460,8798360," So, you can just make it like this."
8798360,8800520," And, uh, yeah."
8800520,8802780," We should remove, uh, equals here."
8802780,8804060," That compiles."
8804060,8805840," Uh, oh yeah."
8805840,8807160," This one has to be aware."
8807160,8810080," Uh-huh."
8810080,8810700," Otherwise."
8810700,8811560," Oh yeah."
8811640,8813600," If we're gonna return something here."
8813600,8819000," It has to be, uh, just get it here."
8820440,8822360," And what, what do you want from me?"
8822360,8825360," Is this because of a single space?"
8825360,8829060," Why, what do you want from me?"
8829060,8830000," Parse input."
8830000,8832120," Oh my god."
8832120,8833060," Seriously."
8833060,8834340," Like, Emacs."
8834340,8837820," I mean, Haskell gets sometimes so annoying."
8838880,8844620," Alright, so, is this not because of its equal, I don't remember."
8844620,8846120," Okay, how do I do condition guards?"
8846120,8848780," Um, how do I do condition guards in Haskell?"
8848780,8850420," Condition guards."
8850420,8855240," Uh, there's something, did I, did I forget something?"
8855240,8861700," It's like, you, you forget like one space and it gets so annoying."
8861700,8866100," Like, yeah, get me to the, to the good part."
8866100,8868380," Uh, alright."
8868880,8870040," So, it is equal."
8870040,8872240," It is, in fact, equal."
8872240,8873460," I have a where here."
8873460,8879920," Um, uh, do I have to add more spaces here?"
8879920,8882640," What do I do?"
8882640,8886340," Dude, this is so frustrating."
8886340,8887260," Oh my god."
8887260,8892600," Like, is, is, is that what you want?"
8892600,8896680," Like, the syntax of Haskell just makes me sad."
8896680,8898420," Like, what do you want?"
8898880,8901200," And it cannot even auto-format anything."
8901200,8905100," Like, finally, finally it works."
8905100,8906660," It magically fucking works."
8906660,8907380," Like, oh my god."
8907380,8908720," It's so, it's heated."
8908720,8911220," Okay."
8913220,8915160," Alright, and here is spam model."
8915160,8917620," Uh, yeah, seriously, like, it's dumb."
8917620,8919560," It's really, really dumb sometimes."
8919560,8925600," Like, uh, I cannot even describe how dumb this is."
8927000,8928040," Um, okay."
8928040,8929160," Um, okay."
8929160,8933460," Okay, finally."
8933460,8937000," Like, I wasn't even fighting with the semantic of the language."
8937000,8938900," I was fighting literally with the syntax."
8938900,8941180," Jesus."
8941920,8944320," Okay, um, next one."
8944320,8948580," Um, spam model."
8948580,8950100," So, here we have a spam model."
8950100,8954100," Uh, and we have a spam bull."
8954100,8956620," To be fair, I don't think we need anything."
8956620,8957740," We can do a same."
8958300,8959580," So, we have a text."
8959580,8962840," Uh, we normalize that text to a word."
8962840,8965160," Which does make sense."
8965160,8968540," Uh, yep."
8968540,8970800," What is at?"
8970800,8972640," Okay, so that's a good question."
8972640,8974780," Um, I forgot how this feature is called."
8974780,8975220," Right."
8975220,8979220," So, essentially, I'm gonna assume that you know what is a pattern matching."
8979220,8979500," Right."
8979940,8985980," So, in a function that accepts, for example, um, like a pair, right?"
8985980,8986720," Pair of integer."
8986720,8991900," And returns something, uh, something else here."
8991900,8994760," You can perform different pattern matching."
8994760,9000760," For example, you can throw away the first argument and only pattern match by the second one."
9000760,9001540," And there you go."
9001540,9002420," You can have a second one."
9002420,9007600," But you lose the access to the whole structure."
9008040,9011780," Once you destructurize it, you don't have the structure."
9011780,9017660," But what if you still want to refer to this pair as a single argument?"
9017660,9018700," Right."
9018700,9022120," In that case, you can just use S pattern."
9022120,9022600," Right."
9022600,9024300," Yeah, as Jung said, S pattern."
9024300,9030080," Um, so, and in that case, A is gonna be equal to the second element of this pair."
9030080,9036220," And X is gonna be equal to the whole pair, including the first one and the second one."
9036220,9037120," Make sense?"
9038040,9041680," So, essentially, you're destructurizing without losing the structure."
9041680,9043780," And here is exactly what I'm doing here."
9043780,9046440," I'm extracting the, uh, the bag of words."
9046440,9051560," But I still can refer to the whole structure because then later I'll have to pass it to scene word."
9051560,9052320," Right."
9052320,9053980," So, that's basically what it does."
9053980,9058900," Uh, that's basically what it does."
9058900,9061760," Hello, uh, Peter Parker."
9062160,9066340," Um, all right."
9066340,9070720," So, um, it's actually pretty common in, uh, languages with pattern matching."
9070900,9072940," I think you have something similar in a camel."
9072940,9078860," I'm not sure if you have something similar in Rust because Rust also enables you with, uh, pattern matching, but I don't really know."
9078860,9086460," I think you should put hair in the stream title for, well, I mean, I did it and people still were asking because apparently people don't read the titles."
9086460,9090600," Uh, okay, I'm going to put, uh, the hair in the title."
9090600,9092720," Okay."
9092720,9094340," So, uh, cool."
9094340,9098340," So, we have this thing and, uh, here's the spam."
9099760,9105080," So, here are the words and then I want to calculate the probabilities."
9105080,9121060," Um, and here's an interesting thing about, uh, uh, functions that return, um, um, maybe we can use something like map, map, maybe."
9121060,9126540," Uh, then we need a wig."
9126540,9127800," Why do I need a wig?"
9127800,9128920," I don't need a wig."
9128920,9134940," Um, it's located in data, maybe, which is kind of strange."
9134940,9139140," Okay, I need to make this code compilable, but I cannot, so I'm going to just put it like that."
9139140,9140840," Okay, so here's the interesting function."
9140840,9148320," It takes list of A's and a function from A to maybe B and returns the list of B's."
9150200,9151800," It's very interesting, in fact."
9151800,9162440," So, essentially, it will apply this function to each element and throw away every element that returns nothing."
9162440,9164620," Yes, it's a map plus filter."
9164620,9166620," You're welcome, Zhiyang."
9166620,9180180," So, uh, because I know the, the need for this kind of function, uh, arise, arise, arises quite often in, when you program in,"
9180180,9181080," in a pure function style."
9181080,9185040," I forgot the word, uh, the, the verb, uh, for a second."
9185040,9185440," I'm sorry."
9185440,9186500," Uh, arises."
9186500,9187100," Okay, thank you."
9187100,9187600," Thank you so much."
9187600,9189660," Um, all right."
9189660,9191000," So, and this is what we're going to do here."
9191000,9194340," Map, map, maybe, probability, spam."
9194340,9196480," Right."
9196480,9204120," And as already mentioned, probabilities, we may not know the probability for that word because we've never seen that word before."
9204500,9205940," And we want to ignore it."
9205940,9209060," And because of that, if we don't know the probability, we just return nothing."
9209060,9215620," And by doing map, maybe, probability, spam for words, we can do exactly that quite easily."
9216420,9226200," So, and then we can have inverse probability, inverse probability, and then the probability, the, uh, product of all the probabilities."
9226200,9228020," There we go."
9228580,9232780," And then we'll just have to return this formula for the whole message."
9232780,9233980," There we go."
9233980,9235740," That should work."
9235740,9239480," Uh, probability, spam should accept."
9241480,9246200," Okay, so, uh, word probability, spam."
9246200,9251260," Yeah, and, god damn, that's actually very interesting."
9251260,9256880," So, that means it has to use a different order for some reason."
9256880,9259780," Okay, so I fucked up the order, but that's not that big of a deal."
9259780,9261300," Oh, my god."
9261300,9263460," What's going on?"
9263460,9266560," Okay."
9266560,9267980," Spam."
9268180,9272820," I'm working on a spam filter, and I'm literally receiving spam as I code."
9272820,9273700," Nice."
9273700,9275860," Oh, shit."
9275860,9276360," That's funny."
9276360,9277660," Uh, okay."
9277660,9279260," Spam."
9279260,9287400," Um, so, and in here, uh, I can just do something."
9287400,9292180," So, I need to finish that spam filter as soon as possible, because I'm already receiving spam."
9292180,9293240," It's, it's unbearable."
9293240,9294420," I need it right now."
9294420,9297300," And also, this thing doesn't have to be IO."
9298180,9300860," Finally, we've done it."
9300860,9303020," We've fucking done it."
9303020,9305800," Uh, okay."
9305800,9307500," So, I wonder what's gonna happen."
9320060,9326740," So, now, we are ignoring the words we've never seen before."
9326740,9331360," So, and I wonder if it's gonna help, uh, with our classifier."
9331360,9333460," So, okay."
9333460,9336180," So, text probability spam."
9336180,9339500," Uh, we'll have to provide the model, the spam model."
9341400,9344160," Uh, so, where is the spam?"
9344160,9346280," So, I can do something like SM."
9346280,9347900," Spam model."
9347900,9349840," I'm gonna create the spam model."
9349840,9350500," Here it is."
9350500,9352080," It's the spam model."
9352080,9358460," So, then I can take the probability of this thing being a spam."
9359020,9360180," And it's spam."
9360180,9363960," And it still does this shit."
9363960,9365800," Goddammit."
9365800,9369220," So, that means at some point, these things."
9369220,9373400," Oh my god."
9373400,9375560," Uh, it literally just doesn't work."
9375920,9380260," Okay, let me try to, uh, um, try to debug all that."
9380260,9381680," So, here are the words."
9381680,9392240," Um, yeah, it's, um, then we take, we can take maybe probability."
9392240,9395240," Variable, nothing, let's go."
9395240,9398640," Well, because I have to, yeah, I have to take this thing."
9398640,9401420," I'm gonna just quickly tablo-shoot step by step."
9401420,9403140," So, here are the probabilities."
9403140,9406240," It always returns probability either 1 or 0."
9406240,9407440," This is so strange."
9407440,9410280," Is it because the float doesn't have enough precision?"
9410280,9412220," Is that the reason?"
9412220,9414400," It could be the reason."
9414400,9415840," Maybe we have too many words."
9415840,9421680," What if we, uh, replace float with double?"
9421680,9423820," Right."
9423820,9425040," What if we just use double?"
9425040,9428800," It, it feels like maybe float just simply doesn't have enough precision to do that."
9428800,9432120," Um, they're very, very low."
9432780,9433520," Uh, okay."
9433520,9437000," So, a sem spam module."
9437000,9442660," It's still not really work."
9442660,9443840," It doesn't really work."
9443840,9448380," Like, why are these, what do I even do about it?"
9448380,9451600," Do I just need more data?"
9451600,9452960," Is that what I need to do?"
9452960,9454640," Do I just need more data?"
9454640,9458460," Uh, maybe that's what I need."
9458460,9462880," So, maybe this amount of data is just not enough."
9462880,9465700," Okay, let me take a look at them."
9466680,9469160," So, here's a spam, uh, spam model."
9469160,9469440," Right."
9469440,9474980," I can do, um, spam, bowl."
9474980,9477560," Was it, was it print?"
9477560,9478940," I forgot what was the name."
9478940,9480940," Summary bowl."
9480940,9483860," Summary bowl."
9484480,9484820," Okay."
9484820,9484820," Okay."
9484820,9484840," Okay."
9484840,9487180," Yeah."
9487180,9490880," It is very, very low."
9490880,9494500," And maybe that's what affects it."
9494500,9498920," Can we have, like, a bigger text?"
9498920,9502220," Okay, let's, let's, let's try to find more text."
9502220,9504200," We could try to debug one word manually."
9504200,9506820," Uh, they are, they are present only in Ham and spam."
9506820,9512440," That's, uh, well, yeah, they're probably present."
9512440,9514000," Okay."
9514000,9517280," So, for example, hello, right?"
9517280,9532760," If I take a look at the world, hello, text, probability, spam, SM, uh, word, probability."
9534200,9557860," Spam is one, um, word, probability, spam, um, word, probability, spam, uh, so it accepts."
9564200,9567080," It's very low."
9567080,9570240," And what about Ham?"
9570240,9572620," It is actually zero."
9572620,9577700," Integer arithmetic somewhere."
9577700,9578900," I don't think so."
9578900,9581060," So here's the hello, right?"
9581060,9581800," So."
9589800,9596720," Um, and this thing divided by one, since it's, it's present in, we just literally don't have enough data."
9596720,9598300," That's the problem here."
9598300,9601340," We literally don't have enough data."
9601340,9605400," Um, so, uh, let's try to find more data."
9605400,9611560," Um, so there's also this, uh, thingy."
9611560,9612540," Do they have enough data?"
9612540,9615000," Um, oh my God."
9615000,9616060," Why is this so slow?"
9616600,9626420," Um, so examples, okay, uh, email, spam, ham, data sets."
9626420,9629880," So I need more data."
9629880,9631540," I need more data."
9631540,9632440," Spam classifier."
9632440,9643280," I'm using, okay, um, spam data sets, which are the best spam data sets."
9643880,9644140," Okay."
9644140,9645420," Spam classifier."
9645420,9651440," Uh, so there's this email archive."
9651440,9655500," The proper, it's just preprocessed form."
9655500,9663120," Uh, Aaron, spam, spam messages."
9663120,9663540," Okay."
9663540,9664780," It's back."
9664780,9665200," Okay."
9665200,9667180," So we do have something here."
9667180,9674760," Um, this is a spam in preprocessed form."
9674760,9676080," Let's take a look at this thing."
9676080,9678300," Uh, let's take a look at some of this."
9678300,9680680," We need some spam."
9680680,9682480," I can forward my spam folder to you."
9682480,9683300," Thank you very much."
9683300,9684240," Okay."
9684240,9688820," Um, and let me see."
9692200,9692720," Okay."
9692720,9693960," RFT."
9693960,9694980," Back."
9694980,9695560," S."
9695560,9698120," How many of them do we have?"
9698120,9699460," That's actually 2004."
9699460,9700200," Look at that."
9700200,9703580," Uh, that's a lot of, okay."
9703580,9704640," That's, that's cool."
9704640,9707860," Uh, maybe that's exactly what we need."
9707860,9710240," Uh, also let me check."
9710240,9712360," So back."
9712360,9713060," S."
9714340,9717140," I hope there will be nothing like Monka2S there."
9717140,9720980," Let's try to unpack this entire thing."
9720980,9724020," Hopefully it's not going to blow up in my folder."
9724020,9729120," Uh, back as, uh, promotions."
9729120,9730860," Let's take a look at some promotions."
9730860,9734000," It's going to be, uh, what's that?"
9734000,9739400," Uh, so it contains the stuff."
9740240,9745240," Um, so we have to parse the format, right?"
9745240,9746880," We have to parse this format first."
9746880,9747980," Maybe we don't care."
9747980,9752120," Yeah, I think we have to care."
9752120,9754320," So we have to pre-process all this stuff."
9754320,9758380," So they do have, uh, the pre-processed form, right?"
9761480,9763140," Uh, spam in a row form."
9763140,9764360," Okay."
9764360,9770460," Uh, unfortunately we don't have a ham."
9770460,9779480," So what we can do is essentially maybe we can try to generate like ham messages or maybe"
9779480,9784840," take like a huge body of text and just say, this is ham and split it into small pieces."
9786360,9790900," Um, so something like that."
9790900,9795020," All right."
9795020,9798740," So, uh, let me take a look at the cleaned up version."
9798740,9802240," Uh, maybe the cleaned up version is actually better."
9802240,9805620," So here's the cleaned up version."
9807820,9812480," Uh, eron in anron one txt."
9812480,9814960," Oh, what the hell is going on?"
9814960,9819760," Anron."
9819760,9822940," Come on."
9822940,9824100," All right."
9824100,9825440," How many of them do we have there?"
9825440,9827860," Five thousands."
9827860,9828640," Okay."
9828640,9829740," Cool."
9829740,9832340," Um, fwx."
9832340,9834180," Just extract everything."
9836500,9839160," Um, I cannot properly do that."
9839160,9839380," Okay."
9839380,9841820," So this is, oh, they both contain ham and spam."
9841820,9845220," Uh, oh shit."
9845220,9846800," I think this is, this is actually cool."
9846800,9852700," So there is a lot of data."
9852700,9853020," Okay."
9853020,9858660," So yeah, like we have a lot of data here that we just, that we can just use."
9858660,9864820," Um, cool."
9865180,9867720," Oh shit."
9867720,9868900," All right."
9868900,9871800," That's a lot of data."
9871800,9872140," Okay."
9872140,9873440," Let's actually download all of that."
9873440,9878600," Um, because we only had like a hundred messages, but here we have thousands in a single archive."
9878600,9879480," So yeah."
9879480,9880900," So now we have way more data."
9880900,9881480," We can, yeah."
9881480,9882880," So this is actually pretty big data."
9882880,9886040," Uh, not really big data, big data."
9886040,9886660," You know what I mean?"
9886660,9887420," If you know what I mean?"
9888060,9894620," Uh, so in the read me, uh, maybe I'm going to actually replace this reference because this"
9894620,9896520," actually turned out kind of useless for us."
9896520,9898280," We're going to use this, uh, yeah."
9898280,9901780," Uh, for this data."
9901780,9909460," Uh, okay."
9909460,9912620," Uh, so let's try to download all of them."
9912620,9920080," Um, so let's remove these things."
9922320,9932480," Now, um, is there like a quick way for me to download all of that?"
9932940,9937840," So if I take the second one and copy paste it here, okay."
9937840,9938480," There is the same."
9938480,9939720," And we have six of them."
9939720,9941220," Three, one, two, three."
9941220,9946580," And, uh, that means I can do something like, uh, three, four, five, six."
9946580,9953480," And, uh, then I can do WGET and simply look at that."
9953480,9956680," So I'm going to go to the data and this is how we're going to download all of them."
9956680,9961600," Uh, downloading everything."
9962940,9965100," Magic of Bash."
9965100,9966180," How about that?"
9966180,9974080," Uh, it didn't download the last one."
9974080,9976540," It's coming."
9976540,9981920," It's coming."
9981920,9985920," From Integral, what is your question from me or whatever your nickname?"
9985920,9987200," I don't know how to pronounce it."
9987200,9988120," What is your question?"
9988120,9992440," Like, you didn't ask a question to answer at all."
9992580,9996580," Like, you're trying to ask something, but nobody understands what you're trying to ask."
9996580,9998460," All right."
9998460,10001320," So, um, yeah."
10001320,10002140," What do we have here?"
10002140,10005960," Eron two, Eron one."
10005960,10007300," Yeah."
10007300,10011480," We'll have to, like, uh, you know, unzip all of that manually."
10013860,10023960," Oh, boy."
10023960,10024660," Okay."
10024660,10024780," Okay."
10024780,10025980," Uh, so."
10025980,10030220," Cool."
10030220,10035860," Uh, let's unpack all of this shit."
10035860,10050720," Uh, now I need to, uh, some people just live in their own world."
10050720,10051620," What can they say?"
10051620,10058120," Uh, they just live in their own world and they're speaking with, like, their own creatures there."
10060120,10061100," What can they say?"
10061100,10062160," Uh, okay."
10062160,10063140," So, here's the ham."
10063140,10066800," And I wish I could quickly copy-paste everything there."
10066800,10073440," Hence, integer arithmetic."
10073640,10075420," There is no integer arithmetic there."
10075420,10078400," Because that wouldn't compile."
10078400,10080640," Finally, you asked a proper question."
10080640,10082460," That was so difficult."
10082460,10082800," Okay."
10082800,10084120," From integral."
10084120,10084740," All right."
10085320,10086400," So, let's take a look at it."
10086400,10087660," From integral."
10087660,10089360," Look."
10089360,10091040," Um."
10091040,10095200," Uh, we are supposed to return devil."
10095200,10099920," If there was integer arithmetic involved, uh, it wouldn't compile."
10099920,10101260," First of all."
10101260,10102780," It just wouldn't compile."
10102780,10103760," Right?"
10103760,10106040," And let's take a look at the form integral function."
10106040,10109020," Uh, what does it do?"
10109020,10111540," Uh, we should, uh, start up a little bit faster."
10111540,10111780," Okay."
10112700,10117660," It takes an integral type and returns a."
10117660,10122760," So, and the way it works, along with the type inference, if you try to do something like"
10122760,10127600," from integral and put an integer here, it's not really going to compile and it will return"
10127600,10129180," you, like, whatever type."
10129180,10130120," It will return your number."
10130120,10135300," But what's interesting is that if you force the type to be double, it will return you double."
10136980,10144440," And what's interesting is that since we require this function to return double, this expression"
10144440,10146180," is required to be double."
10146180,10153360," And that means each individual argument of this operant is required to be double, which forces"
10153360,10155760," both of the from integrals return double."
10156760,10159460," That's how type inference works in Haskell."
10159460,10160880," Seriously."
10160880,10166600," So, from integral, uh, can return you any number constructed from integral type."
10166600,10170380," You just need to hint what kind of type it should return."
10170380,10175740," The way we hint it to return double is by saying that this function returns double and everything"
10175740,10177640," else is done by type inference."
10177640,10178680," Does it make sense?"
10180220,10181520," So, this is how it works."
10181520,10182680," Welcome to Haskell."
10182680,10189920," And, for example, if you have an integer, right, I can even force it like that."
10189920,10192080," So, here's an integer, right?"
10192080,10193420," This is integer."
10193420,10196900," And you have another integer, like this."
10196900,10199560," And you apply from integral on both of them."
10199560,10204400," And you divide one by another."
10204400,10209060," I'm simulating the situation we have in the code."
10209180,10211700," And then I force the whole expression to be double."
10211700,10217000," Makes sense?"
10217000,10227380," All right."
10227380,10238300," So, we need to now to put all of this data into the training set."
10238300,10241140," Uh, so, here's the train."
10241140,10245160," And, um, so, this is errand one."
10245160,10246760," So, I'm going here."
10246760,10248060," Then I go here."
10248060,10250500," Oh, boy."
10250500,10254040," Um, I wonder."
10254040,10257020," Can I just copy-paste this stuff there?"
10257020,10258040," All right."
10258040,10259500," Let's just try to copy-paste it."
10259500,10262940," Uh, so, I'm located here."
10263580,10264020," Right."
10264020,10266020," And I'm going to even do it like that."
10266020,10268800," And I want to copy-paste it."
10268800,10270260," Uh, so, one bag."
10270260,10271700," One bag."
10271700,10274000," Train ham."
10274000,10276240," I'm going to leave it here."
10276240,10277480," I think it's going to be important."
10278680,10281240," So, maybe it also makes sense to move it."
10281240,10283300," Cool."
10283300,10288040," And now, how many files do we have here?"
10288040,10290920," We have, uh, three thousand files."
10290920,10292200," Three thousand files."
10292200,10297960," Uh, as an opposite to, uh, 50 of them."
10298340,10299980," And this is only one archive."
10299980,10301680," This is only one archive."
10301680,10307360," Um, so, maybe we're going to get along with just one archive."
10307360,10311460," Uh, all right."
10311460,10312180," Spam."
10312180,10315020," So, we have 50 of this thing here."
10315020,10319240," And, uh, we have 100."
10319240,10319740," Okay."
10319740,10323560," So, uh, we have to move that to spam."
10323560,10326420," Okay."
10327960,10328580," Oh, boy."
10328580,10328840," Oh, boy."
10328840,10329140," Oh, boy."
10329140,10329480," Oh, boy."
10329480,10331880," Oh, boy."
10331880,10338840," Uh, I can get really lost super easy."
10338840,10340440," Um, I don't like that."
10340440,10342420," So, this is empty."
10342420,10344220," This is also empty."
10344220,10345500," Uh, okay."
10345500,10345800," Okay."
10345800,10348320," Then, the train spam should contain."
10348320,10349920," Yeah."
10349920,10351620," It should contain several thousands of them."
10351620,10352460," All right."
10352460,10354640," So, and here is the cool."
10354640,10354840," Cool."
10354840,10355060," Cool."
10355060,10355680," Okay."
10355680,10357940," So, now, instead of, like, 50 emails."
10357960,10359800," We have thousands of them."
10359800,10361940," And only from the first archive."
10361940,10362980," Which is already good."
10362980,10365940," So, if we're not going to have enough data."
10365940,10367480," We can add another archive."
10367480,10368920," Because another archive here."
10368920,10371620," Contains another thousands of hams."
10371620,10373900," And another thousands of spams."
10373900,10375820," Uh, okay."
10377520,10378760," So, let's, let's give it a try."
10378760,10380960," So, I'm pretty sure it will take some time."
10380960,10383320," Because the, the model is way bigger."
10383320,10384560," No."
10384560,10386900," So, um."
10386900,10389420," Spam ball."
10389420,10392320," Yeah."
10392380,10392980," I need to do."
10392980,10393000," I need to do."
10393000,10393020," I need to do."
10393020,10393020," I need to do."
10393020,10394920," SM."
10394920,10395940," Spam."
10395940,10398220," Model."
10398220,10399700," So, here is a spam model."
10399700,10400660," And."
10400660,10404420," Invalid sequence of bytes."
10404420,10405560," Are you serious?"
10405560,10409380," What the hell is wrong with this particular file?"
10410800,10411140," Okay."
10411140,10411900," Data."
10411900,10412780," Train."
10412780,10414100," Spam."
10414100,10415620," 414."
10415620,10421080," Oh, shit."
10421080,10421880," What the fuck?"
10421880,10425580," Okay."
10425580,10428560," So, apparently we have a Unicode situation."
10428560,10429860," On our hands."
10429860,10434200," We have a Unicode situation."
10434200,10435220," On our hands."
10435220,10436480," Um."
10440800,10443440," So, how."
10443440,10445020," Why doesn't it work though?"
10445020,10445440," Uh."
10445440,10446120," It's kind of strange."
10446120,10448760," So, alright."
10448760,10452500," So, here is the path."
10452500,10456280," Because text is supposed to work with, uh."
10456280,10456800," You know."
10456800,10458680," Unicode."
10458680,10461100," So, that means if I do something like read file."
10461100,10462260," This thing."
10462260,10463520," Uh."
10463520,10464880," It should work."
10464880,10466120," But it doesn't."
10466120,10469080," It doesn't work."
10469080,10470060," Yeah."
10470160,10471840," It literally cannot encode that."
10471840,10472520," Uh."
10472520,10474180," It cannot read that file at all."
10474180,10475120," Um."
10475120,10475640," Okay."
10475640,10478440," So, one way we can try to do that."
10478440,10480060," Is by reading."
10480060,10481000," The file."
10481000,10483480," A file as a sequence of bytes."
10483480,10486100," And trying to encode it."
10486100,10486520," Uh."
10486520,10487940," With UTF-8 or something."
10487940,10491280," But maybe that's exactly what they tried to do."
10491280,10493660," And they couldn't."
10493660,10497740," Hmm."
10498740,10500800," But this file looks like a."
10500800,10501260," Like."
10501260,10502040," You know."
10502040,10502860," Just a."
10502860,10504380," Yeah."
10504380,10505620," It's just some Unicode stuff."
10505620,10507480," So, apparently it just couldn't handle that."
10507480,10508140," Alright."
10508140,10509780," Um."
10509780,10511400," For that."
10511400,10513840," We'll need a byte string package."
10513840,10514840," That's what we'll need."
10514840,10516720," We'll need a byte string package."
10516720,10522800," So, apparently text package is incapable of handling UTF-8 by itself."
10523260,10526220," So, we'll need the help of a byte string package."
10526220,10527260," As far as I know."
10527260,10527820," Um."
10527820,10531680," It comes with installation."
10531680,10535620," So, I can grab a byte string here."
10535620,10536740," So, here it is."
10536740,10539440," We even have base64 byte string."
10539440,10540340," Would you look at that."
10540340,10544840," The most reliable encryption algorithm of all time."
10545520,10546560," So, here's the cabal."
10546560,10547520," And I'm going to put this."
10547520,10549040," This is not what I wanted."
10549040,10549780," Oh my god."
10549780,10552340," The clipboards in Linux, by the way."
10552340,10556180," Linux has way too many clipboards."
10556180,10560940," They confuse me all the time."
10564520,10565920," What's up, Profiber69."
10565920,10566940," Welcome to the stream."
10566940,10570720," Alrighty."
10570720,10571460," And."
10571460,10574040," Can we compile all of that now?"
10574040,10574740," Yeah, I think."
10574740,10577740," What are you waiting for?"
10577740,10579020," It's doing something."
10579020,10579760," What is."
10579760,10580220," Okay."
10580220,10581700," So, there's a lot of untracked files."
10581700,10582060," I see."
10582060,10584460," Okay."
10584460,10585120," So."
10585120,10586660," Alright."
10586660,10589380," Compile file changed."
10589380,10590740," So, now."
10594520,10596880," In a text."
10596880,10598780," In a text package."
10598780,10600320," In a text package."
10600320,10601640," In a text package."
10601640,10603860," I wish this website would work a little bit faster."
10603860,10609560," I just need a documentation for text package, please."
10609560,10611380," I don't need much in my life."
10611380,10613040," Just a documentation for the text package."
10613040,10615120," I don't ask for too much."
10615120,10617200," Okay."
10617200,10618160," Index."
10618160,10619120," Alright."
10619120,10621460," So, there was something about encoding."
10621460,10623560," Let me take a look."
10623560,10624160," Encoding."
10624520,10625780," Yeah."
10625780,10626620," Encode."
10626620,10627680," UTF-8."
10627680,10629640," So, this is basically what we're going to."
10629640,10631840," Expect here."
10631840,10633000," Actually."
10633000,10635320," It was something like decode."
10635320,10636660," Decode."
10636660,10637620," UTF-8."
10637620,10639460," There we go."
10639460,10640840," Decode."
10640840,10641540," UTF-8."
10641540,10643880," So, we accept byte string."
10643880,10644340," Right."
10644340,10647080," Decode byte string containing UTF-8 input text."
10647080,10648780," That is known to be valid."
10648780,10651860," If the input contains any invalid UTF-8 data."
10651860,10653700," An exception will be thrown."
10653700,10655400," That cannot be caught."
10655400,10655860," In period."
10655860,10656240," Caught."
10656240,10659140," For more control over."
10659140,10661260," Use UTF-8 prime."
10661260,10664500," So, which returns you either exception."
10664500,10664900," Okay."
10664900,10665640," That's very interesting."
10665640,10667720," But maybe that's exactly what happens."
10667720,10670860," Does read file actually tries to decode UTF-8?"
10670860,10671820," That's a good question."
10672820,10677800," Let's take a look at the UTF-8 file."
10677800,10681260," Read file."
10681260,10684620," When you call read file, does it assume UTF-8?"
10684620,10686280," Read file."
10686280,10687400," Returns the content of the file."
10687400,10687780," The string."
10687860,10691620," The entire file is very strictly as gets constant contents."
10691620,10692740," Contents."
10692740,10696200," It doesn't say anything about encoding."
10696200,10701880," So, that means that probably doesn't encode anything."
10701880,10707960," Let's do import qualified data byte string as B."
10710020,10710680," Yes, please."
10710680,10711980," No."
10711980,10713100," Oh my god."
10713100,10714860," You don't need..."
10714860,10716900," Emacs is dumb."
10716900,10719600," Emacs is super dumb."
10719600,10720680," Okay."
10720680,10722780," Let's restart this entire thing."
10728060,10728980," Come on."
10728980,10731840," I don't know why I decided to take a look at the Magit status."
10731840,10734820," I think it was not a wise choice."
10734820,10737300," Just give me the ripple."
10737300,10738960," I'm not asking for too much."
10738960,10740280," Just give me the ripple."
10740280,10741340," Come on."
10741340,10742080," You can do that."
10742080,10743520," Just load dependencies."
10743520,10744320," Do whatever."
10744320,10748420," Okay."
10748420,10748940," Finally."
10748940,10749680," Thank you so much."
10749680,10750500," I really appreciate it."
10750500,10750740," Okay."
10750740,10751440," So, read file."
10751440,10753620," Yeah."
10753620,10755100," That's exactly what I'm talking about."
10755100,10757900," And let me try to..."
10758060,10761180," Take a..."
10761180,10762280," So, there was a spam."
10762280,10764940," I lost the file path, unfortunately."
10764940,10769140," Oh, lane ripple is just..."
10769140,10769280," Yeah."
10769280,10772460," Lane by itself is the most horrible build tool I've ever seen."
10772460,10775160," Like, the amount of time you have to wait is just..."
10775160,10775540," Oh my god."
10775540,10779020," And people are okay with that."
10779020,10781240," Spam model."
10781240,10781780," Okay."
10781780,10782620," Here's a spam model."
10782620,10784580," And that's exactly what I'm talking about."
10784580,10787720," That's exactly what I'm talking about."
10788060,10791120," Come on."
10791120,10793120," It's too much time."
10793120,10795440," B."
10795440,10796880," Read file."
10796880,10798200," Okay."
10798200,10799640," Is it gonna work?"
10799640,10802380," Can I do, like, a B length?"
10802380,10803520," I wanna force it."
10803520,10807220," I wanna force it and see that it reads this file successfully."
10807220,10807840," Okay."
10807840,10810740," It, in fact, reads this file successfully."
10811120,10814860," Now, can I do text decode UTF-8?"
10814860,10816100," Straight up."
10816100,10821140," It doesn't have decode UTF-8 because it's located somewhere else."
10821140,10823420," It's located in data text encoding."
10823680,10823940," Okay."
10823940,10826040," So, we'll have to do import."
10826040,10828560," Qualify it."
10828560,10831260," Data text encoding."
10831260,10832960," ST."
10832960,10834360," So, we're gonna put everything there."
10834360,10835240," Hello, Firefox."
10837240,10837580," Okay."
10837580,10841740," So, it is invalid UTF-8."
10841740,10845980," In fact, it is straight up invalid UTF-8."
10845980,10854140," So, maybe one of the things we can do, we can try to skip the files that are not valid UTF-8."
10854820,10856800," So, this is one of the things we can try to do."
10856800,10858100," Just skip them."
10858100,10860360," Because we have an opportunity to do so, right?"
10860360,10863020," We can just use decode UTF-8 prime."
10863020,10866940," And it will just give us exception in a pure code."
10866940,10868960," Yeah."
10868960,10871560," So, I'm gonna put prime."
10871560,10874160," And as you can see, it just gives us that."
10874160,10874740," Yeah."
10874740,10879540," Doesn't it confuse us with other imports as T?"
10879540,10879900," No."
10879900,10881580," It actually adds them to the T."
10881580,10883480," It accumulates all of them."
10884500,10888100," So, essentially, I basically import three modules into a single namespace."
10888100,10891400," Because all of them are related to text."
10891400,10897800," And the only problem may occur if the names between these modules will collide."
10897800,10899240," But they don't collide so far."
10899240,10900100," So, it's okay."
10900100,10909780," I guess that's the clever way for spammer to spam."
10909780,10911160," Use invalid UTF-8."
10911160,10912220," Break the Valdeers."
10912220,10913160," Yeah."
10914180,10915420," Okay."
10915420,10918400," Okay."
10918400,10919040," So,"
10919040,10922280," bo from file."
10922280,10924520," So, this is where we use the read file."
10924520,10925800," Okay."
10925800,10928280," And this is how we're gonna go about that."
10928280,10931080," So, this is gonna be b read file."
10931080,10932060," File path."
10932060,10933500," And that gives us the bytes."
10933500,10935540," That gives us the bytes."
10938000,10946580," And then we are trying to decode UTF at prime bytes and then match all of that."
10946580,10948700," Actually, k is off."
10948700,10949740," And if it's..."
10949740,10952660," Maybe we have to return like maybe."
10952660,10955220," Write bo from file."
10955220,10961060," Because then we can do bo from folder."
10961060,10971240," So, this is gonna be a right."
10971240,10974560," So, this is gonna be content."
10975740,10976180," And..."
10976180,10977500," Text."
10977500,10978240," Yeah."
10978240,10978740," Text."
10978740,10980300," To bo."
10980300,10981880," Text."
10981880,10986720," Otherwise, if it's left, we don't really care about it."
10986720,10987840," We just return nothing."
10987840,10989600," Yep."
10990120,10991860," So, let's see if it's gonna work."
10991860,10994340," It actually has to ignore this thing."
10994340,10997080," It has to be just."
10997080,10998580," Also return."
10998580,11000440," Yeah."
11000440,11002780," But, you know, you can move return to here."
11002780,11003840," It's also gonna work."
11003840,11005940," Uh-huh."
11005940,11007980," Okay."
11007980,11010540," So, now when we use this kind of stuff,"
11010540,11013400," instead of single bo."
11013400,11016020," No."
11019020,11022140," We have maybe bowls, right?"
11022140,11024780," So, we have a bunch of maybe bowls."
11024780,11027680," Which we need to filter out."
11027680,11029420," So, and the way we're gonna do that,"
11029420,11031300," I think I'm gonna do map maybe ID."
11031300,11034900," Which will filter out everything that is nothing."
11034900,11036900," And then we're gonna follow them."
11036900,11037960," And now it works."
11037960,11039440," So, essentially what we're doing right now,"
11039440,11043180," we're ignoring the files that we cannot read."
11043180,11045680," And the question is, how many files we cannot read?"
11045680,11048400," So, I don't know."
11049340,11050300," We'll see, we'll see."
11050300,11051740," Okay."
11051740,11055800," So, the next thing I'm gonna try to read spam model."
11055800,11056140," Okay."
11056140,11057620," The spam model has been read."
11058160,11065120," And I can take spam bowl SM and take a look at the words count for that one."
11065120,11067420," And how many words do we have for the spam?"
11067420,11070840," Probably, yeah, that's a decent amount of words."
11070840,11074540," I think hundreds of thousands of words is actually pretty decent."
11074540,11075180," Not gonna lie."
11075720,11076600," So, what about ham?"
11076600,11078820," For ham, we're probably gonna have even more."
11078820,11083800," Yeah."
11083800,11086440," So, I think this is a decent amount of words."
11086440,11087360," What do you guys think?"
11087360,11090940," So, if we're not gonna have enough of that,"
11090940,11092660," maybe we're gonna add even more."
11093660,11095940," But so far, this looks promising."
11095940,11101380," So, now, we can just try to do word probability spam."
11101380,11103800," And let's take a look at the word hello."
11103800,11106300," What's the probability of word hello being spam?"
11108940,11110580," That's already something reasonable."
11110580,11112560," That looks like a proper probability."
11112560,11115000," Like, 86%."
11115000,11117560," Actually, 87% if you're around it properly."
11117560,11121480," That's already fucking something."
11121480,11122620," Okay."
11122620,11127600," So, now, we can try to do text probability, right?"
11127600,11131440," So, how do I apply that?"
11131440,11133500," So, it accepts spam numbers."
11133500,11135520," And if I put hello world here."
11135520,11138100," Excuse me."
11138940,11140040," Oh, it has to be text."
11140040,11144520," It's a 90% probability of this being a spam."
11144520,11145300," Okay."
11145300,11146860," So, I can..."
11146860,11148640," I wanna take this message, right?"
11148640,11149760," I'm gonna take this message."
11149760,11150800," And I'm gonna put it here."
11150800,11153480," And let's see how probable it is it's a spam."
11153480,11154660," It's 100% spam."
11154660,11157940," It's 100% spam."
11157940,11158820," That's very strange."
11158820,11162480," Spam mails."
11162480,11165720," That's really strange."
11165720,11167300," Why is that 100% spam?"
11168640,11172140," So, that's kind of strange."
11172140,11175840," So, let's take a look at some other messages."
11175840,11178960," People don't say much."
11178960,11183960," It's just so funny."
11184080,11190560," So, the whole chat is filled with, you know, hair, copypasta, because people keep asking."
11190560,11193600," Yeah."
11193600,11196700," So, that's actually less likely to be a spam."
11199220,11199560," Okay."
11199560,11201820," So, let's take a look at some other things."
11201820,11204400," Maybe this kind of text."
11204400,11206860," This kind of text."
11213760,11215200," This is totally spam."
11215200,11216500," Huh."
11216500,11221380," It's really strange."
11221380,11222880," It's trying to do something."
11222880,11226080," Consider your spam."
11226080,11226420," Okay."
11226420,11227220," Let's see."
11227220,11230640," Chat is cute."
11231180,11231540," Yeah, yeah."
11231540,11231620," Yeah, yeah."
11231620,11234180," It is totally spam."
11234180,11235720," Yes, it is totally spam."
11235720,11239460," That's pretty strange."
11239460,11240560," Like, why is this?"
11240560,11241600," No."
11241600,11245560," Maybe we need more, even more data."
11245560,11248660," Maybe we need to add another archive there."
11249120,11251360," Oh, by the way, we have a validation set."
11251360,11253480," I completely forgot about validation set."
11253480,11254900," Yeah."
11254900,11256400," Yeah."
11256400,11257980," I completely forgot about that one."
11257980,11264200," So, this is something that we can try to now apply to."
11264200,11265140," Right?"
11265140,11268160," Because they're a little bit closer to what we're trying to do here."
11268160,11270000," Yeah."
11270000,11273240," Let's do the validation."
11278360,11281420," So, validate."
11281420,11289740," So, yeah, let's do something like this."
11289740,11292140," Check folder."
11292140,11295000," Check folder."
11295000,11297800," Maybe we're going to start with a check file."
11297800,11298300," Right?"
11298300,11299360," Let's do it with a check file."
11299360,11300500," It's going to be file path."
11300500,11303180," And it will return us a probability."
11303180,11303920," Right."
11303920,11305100," It will return us a probability."
11306960,11310000," Then, we'll have to read the file."
11310000,11317020," So, I'm thinking, I'm going to extract this reading mechanism."
11317020,11322180," Read the file, if possible."
11322180,11323380," Right."
11323380,11325100," It accepts the file path."
11325100,11327940," And returns I.O."
11328380,11328880," Maybe."
11328880,11328900," Maybe."
11328900,11329900," T-text."
11329900,11332840," Right."
11332840,11337400," We'll just do something like this."
11337400,11341040," So, we'll read the bytes."
11341040,11343600," Then, we try to do that."
11343600,11345000," And we simply return the text."
11345540,11350600," So, I'm pretty sure there is, like, a way to turn either to maybe."
11350600,11356580," Is there any, like, standard way without installing any third-party dependencies?"
11356580,11357900," Is my internet dying?"
11357900,11359880," Okay."
11359880,11360560," It's not dying."
11365920,11370540," Either A, B, maybe, B."
11370540,11372580," Can you do something like that?"
11372580,11374600," Is it possible in standard library?"
11374600,11376600," Please tell me it is possible."
11376600,11378280," Write to maybe and it's not standard."
11378280,11378940," Thank you very much."
11378940,11379780," Okay."
11379780,11382940," So, ball to file."
11383440,11388400," And, essentially, we can read the contents."
11388400,11390960," Contexts."
11390960,11393040," Textable."
11393040,11395580," Contents."
11395580,11397860," Read file, if possible."
11397860,11400040," File path."
11400040,11402900," And then, I'm going to return."
11402900,11408660," Textable."
11408660,11411260," Contents."
11411260,11413200," Cool."
11413440,11414140," Is it going to compile?"
11414140,11415120," It does not compile."
11415120,11415740," Because why?"
11415740,11418060," Because I have this text."
11418060,11420740," Does it compile here?"
11420740,11424200," File path."
11424200,11424480," Okay."
11424480,11425160," File path."
11425160,11425840," There we go."
11425840,11427040," Cool."
11427040,11429620," So, read file, if possible."
11429620,11433040," What is going on with the Twitch?"
11433040,11434920," Is everything okay?"
11434920,11438700," Left to maybe, right to maybe."
11438700,11440640," Not a standard way."
11440640,11441840," All right."
11442560,11443620," I already talked about it."
11443620,11447780," So, read file, if possible."
11447780,11448920," Check file."
11448920,11449240," Cool."
11449240,11457960," But maybe in this particular case, I want to just throw an error."
11460660,11461460," So, let's see."
11461460,11464900," So, read file, it's going to be file path."
11464900,11467820," File path."
11467820,11471880," Then, text probability spam."
11471880,11473980," This one has to be double, by the way."
11473980,11478080," So, we have to provide a spam model as well."
11478080,11481140," So, this is a spam model."
11484380,11485920," Text probability spam."
11485920,11488820," Text probability spam."
11488820,11489820," Text probability spam."
11489820,11493040," Wait a second."
11493040,11499820," But what's the probability?"
11499820,11513760," I think, just because the probability of it being a spam is 80%, does it mean that the probability of it being a ham is 20%."
11513760,11514600," 20%."
11514600,11517520," Oh, shit."
11517520,11521740," It doesn't mean that."
11521740,11529260," I think we need an opposite function called text probability ham."
11532060,11532860," Oh, shit."
11532860,11533240," Okay."
11533240,11537080," And then, we can basically have some sort of a threshold."
11537080,11540800," First of all, we can check if the probability of ham is bigger than the probability of it being a spam."
11540800,11543940," And then, we can also have a threshold on top of that."
11543940,11547960," And that would be actually more accurate."
11547960,11548580," You see what I mean?"
11548580,11549800," You see what I mean?"
11549800,11550180," Yes."
11550180,11550480," Yes."
11550540,11550880," Oh, my God."
11550880,11552280," I didn't think about that for some reason."
11552280,11554140," All right."
11554140,11558380," So, and yeah."
11558380,11564480," So, but for that, we'll need, first of all, the function like word probability ham."
11564480,11565000," Right?"
11565000,11566700," So, word probability ham."
11568580,11579040," So, is that a common mistake that people do when they work with this kind of thing?"
11579040,11581360," It feels like maybe it is."
11582360,11583160," Okay."
11583160,11585840," Is the probability of being a spam, probability of being a ham?"
11585840,11591040," So, essentially, what we do here, we just reverse this to PHS and then to PWS."
11591040,11593360," And that gives us the probability of this being a ham."
11593360,11597980," Yeah, I think they're not contrary."
11597980,11598740," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
11598740,11600840," So, I don't think they're contrary."
11600840,11605320," So, and instead of these kinds of stuff, so text probability spam."
11605320,11610660," This is, yeah."
11610660,11617680," And similarly, we can change it to ham."
11617680,11619660," And this one is also going to be ham."
11619660,11621740," Like, we have a little bit of a copy-paste."
11621740,11622660," Hello, mm2pl."
11622660,11623320," Welcome to the stream."
11623320,11627120," But I think I'm going to have a function."
11627120,11632600," ClassifyTextSpamModule."
11632600,11635040," Then we have a text."
11635040,11637540," And it should return double, double."
11637540,11638940," So, first one is going to be spam."
11638940,11640100," The second one is going to be ham."
11640660,11642940," So, and this is a text."
11642940,11646680," And essentially, yeah, we can do it like that."
11646680,11649880," TextProbabilitySpam."
11650040,11651420," So, the first one is a spam."
11651420,11651420," So, the first one is a spam."
11651420,11653060," And textProbabilityHam."
11653060,11660900," Speaking statistically, they are not independent variables."
11660900,11662380," Well, yeah."
11662380,11665140," But I think we're using independent theorem."
11665140,11666140," But we'll see."
11666140,11668660," I just want to see what's going to happen."
11670560,11671940," Okay, it does compile."
11671940,11675700," So, SMSpamModule is a spam model."
11675700,11676860," We read it successfully."
11676860,11679000," And let's try to classify text."
11679000,11681320," Hello, world."
11681320,11682920," And let's see the probabilities."
11682920,11684540," The first probability is a spam."
11684540,11686160," Let me double check that."
11686160,11689180," So, spam uses probability spam."
11689180,11690060," Or it's a spam."
11690060,11691600," The second one is ham."
11693500,11695420," And ham uses more probability ham."
11695420,11698860," And in more probability ham, these things are simply inversed."
11698860,11700080," Nothing special."
11700080,11701580," Oh, shit."
11701580,11703680," Oh, we're up again."
11703680,11704460," We're back again."
11704460,11705480," Refresh your page."
11705480,11706320," I don't know what happened."
11706320,11708060," But I just dropped some frames."
11708060,11709080," I really apologize for that."
11711280,11711720," Okay."
11711720,11716060," SpamModule."
11716060,11716940," Okay."
11716940,11718660," Okay."
11718660,11720640," It's calculating the probabilities."
11720640,11722280," So, it's going to take some time."
11722280,11727600," Because it needs to, like, warm up."
11727600,11731760," Okay."
11731760,11735280," So, the probability of this being a ham is actually pretty low."
11735280,11737400," Hello, world test."
11737400,11740140," Okay."
11741280,11742400," Huh."
11742400,11743020," That's interesting."
11743020,11746500," So, the probability of this being a ham actually goes down."
11746500,11748560," Okay."
11748560,11749840," So, what about hair?"
11749840,11753160," Okay."
11753160,11755140," Let me try to do that one more time."
11755140,11760500," Chatterino doesn't work properly with clipboards."
11760500,11762280," Okay."
11762280,11763880," Let's see."
11763880,11767360," So, it's kind of interesting."
11770860,11771480," All right."
11771480,11773740," So, that makes, that does make sense."
11773740,11778100," Maybe we just need more data."
11778100,11779260," But, yeah."
11779260,11779900," I wish."
11779900,11780440," Yeah, yeah."
11780440,11783240," So, I actually got sidetracked yet again."
11783240,11784840," I got sidetracked yet again."
11784840,11787460," What I need to do here is check the file."
11787460,11787860," Right."
11787860,11790420," Check file."
11790420,11791640," I was working on that."
11791640,11794100," I was working on that."
11794100,11796880," And classify file."
11796880,11797160," Okay."
11797160,11798540," Let's do classify file."
11798540,11804220," It's annoying that it doesn't say the selection clipboard in X."
11804220,11804500," Yeah."
11804500,11806720," Okay."
11806720,11808140," So, this is the file path."
11808140,11809580," And this is what we're going to return."
11810580,11811380," So, double."
11811380,11812740," Double."
11812740,11817560," Okay."
11817560,11820500," And here's the file path."
11820500,11823480," So, t read file."
11823480,11824720," File path."
11824720,11828300," And I'm redirecting that to classify text."
11829580,11830100," Uh-huh."
11830100,11831420," And this one is a sem."
11831420,11832040," Sem."
11832040,11832980," Is it going to compile?"
11832980,11834140," It does not compile."
11834140,11835640," Because why?"
11835640,11837000," What's wrong with that?"
11837000,11838000," What do you want?"
11838000,11843800," What do you want?"
11843800,11845620," Okay."
11845620,11848220," So, I think we have to do it like that."
11852220,11860080," Now, we have the model."
11860080,11867060," Let's try to classify things that are known to be spam or known to be ham."
11867060,11869040," That's what we're going to try to do."
11869040,11872340," So, we have a special folder here to validate things."
11872340,11875860," So, here's the ham."
11875860,11877160," Let's go here."
11877160,11879480," And I'm going to classify."
11879480,11881880," Thank you, MindSpike."
11882220,11883120," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
11883120,11885600," So, we're going to classify a file, I think."
11885600,11887880," So, this is what we're going to do."
11887880,11889620," So, here's the ham."
11889620,11890880," Here's a little bit of ham."
11890880,11894400," And here is a little bit of the bat."
11894400,11897720," And it didn't."
11897720,11898040," Okay."
11898040,11901440," So, that means I need to do something like spam model."
11901440,11903660," Yeah."
11903660,11905500," And I have to provide it here."
11905500,11906580," Okay."
11906580,11911700," It's trying to classify the well-known file to be ham."
11912220,11916420," Let's see how it goes."
11916420,11918800," No, it's still considered spam."
11918800,11924080," What about something that is known to be a spam?"
11924080,11926820," How about that?"
11929820,11930360," Okay."
11930360,11933320," And it's also slow as fuck."
11933320,11934460," Actually."
11934460,11937440," It is 100% spam and probably 0%."
11937440,11938120," Yeah."
11938120,11943140," To be fair, if you have like a pretty..."
11943140,11951220," To be fair, for spam, it says 100%."
11951220,11952540," Look at that."
11952540,11954860," For the spam, it says 100%."
11954860,11956600," So, here's the second file."
11956600,11959140," Yeah."
11959140,11961220," So, what I'm thinking, maybe..."
11961220,11967480," For the ham, essentially, you just have to have a particular threshold."
11967480,11969600," Yeah."
11970440,11972280," I think that's what has to happen."
11972280,11975480," So, for the ham, it has to be a particular threshold."
11975480,11978280," So, for the hams, it's usually lower anyway."
11978280,11979240," Look at that."
11979240,11988360," Everything actually is a spam."
11988360,11990220," Oh, shit."
11990220,11991920," Look at that."
11991920,11995020," Second was confirmed to not be a spam."
11997440,11998560," That's very strange."
11998560,11999300," Look at that."
11999300,12002800," Yeah."
12002800,12004180," It's completely ham."
12004180,12005500," And it is, in fact, ham."
12005500,12014360," So, I have a hypothesis that, on average, hams are just going to simply have less spam-ness."
12014360,12016260," But spams are going to be 100% always."
12016260,12019240," I think that's..."
12019240,12019400," Yeah."
12019400,12020080," Oh, there we go."
12020080,12020780," Okay."
12020780,12025320," So, what about the fourth one?"
12025320,12026820," Yeah."
12027440,12030640," Shit."
12030640,12031700," I think it's working."
12031700,12033400," Oh, fuck."
12033400,12035240," It's fucking working."
12035240,12038140," Can you retry first ham?"
12038140,12039180," I can retry first ham."
12039180,12041460," I think the first ham is kind of, like, suspicious."
12041460,12042860," This is..."
12042860,12043640," Yeah."
12043640,12044940," It is really sus."
12044940,12046560," It is very sus ham."
12046560,12048220," Okay."
12048220,12050800," It is a super sus ham."
12050800,12052500," Yeah, yeah."
12052500,12053500," So, it's very suspicious."
12053500,12055100," Okay."
12055280,12056700," So, you know what I want to do now?"
12056700,12060140," I want to automate that."
12060140,12066060," I want to just iterate through all of the ham files, like, ham validate files and all of"
12066060,12068780," the spam validate files."
12068940,12070000," And look at their statistics."
12070000,12074000," It's going to probably take some time, but..."
12074000,12075100," Yeah, we'll see."
12075100,12083900," If we can reliably detect that these files are spam and these files are ham to some degree,"
12083900,12084980," it doesn't have to be perfect."
12085700,12087400," I think I'm going to call it success."
12087400,12089040," Bash script."
12089040,12094740," I mean, we don't really need a bash script because we have a list directory function that basically"
12094740,12096940," accepts the directory and gives you the list of files."
12096940,12097820," You don't really need that."
12097820,12099580," So, we can use something like that."
12099580,12101640," So, we can classify file."
12101640,12102840," Okay."
12102840,12105540," What is ham?"
12105540,12108080," Ham is something that is not spam."
12109780,12110660," Yes, I know."
12110660,12111700," It's very funny."
12111700,12114420," So, it's a funny joke."
12114420,12120700," And it's a real terminology in this area, by the way."
12120700,12124140," People who work on spam filters, this is their terminology."
12124140,12126420," They call ham something that is not spam."
12126420,12128380," So, ham is something that you want."
12128380,12130420," And spam, this is something that you don't want."
12130780,12146640," So, what do we have here?"
12146640,12148620," Classify file."
12148620,12151060," Maybe let's call it validate."
12151060,12153160," Validate file."
12153160,12157160," I have an idea."
12157160,12158920," Classify folder."
12158920,12160880," You get a spam model."
12160880,12164700," Then, the file path for the folder."
12164700,12170680," And, I don't know."
12170680,12174140," Yeah, I think we're going to do some sort of a summary."
12174140,12177440," And this is going to be a spam model."
12177440,12179420," Folder path."
12179420,12180180," Right."
12180180,12184760," Then, we're going to have file names."
12184760,12187020," List directory."
12187020,12188700," Folder path."
12188920,12191640," And this is where we can iterate all of them."
12191640,12193120," So, it's going to be something like this."
12193120,12194620," File names."
12194620,12197360," File name."
12197360,12200260," And."
12200260,12206420," Stats."
12206420,12209360," Classify file."
12210500,12212060," And how are we going to classify it?"
12212060,12213460," We're going to take folder path."
12213460,12219100," Slash file name."
12219100,12221080," Slash file name."
12221080,12226940," Maybe I'm going to call it let file path."
12226940,12228120," Like this."
12228120,12229440," This is a file path."
12229440,12231000," Classify file."
12231000,12232340," File path."
12232880,12235340," And then, we're going to printf this entire thing."
12235340,12236320," It's going to be printf."
12236320,12239320," S."
12239320,12243040," S."
12243040,12246280," So, file path."
12246280,12248280," Stats."
12248280,12249640," But, stats has to be shown."
12249640,12250780," Like this."
12250780,12253340," And, this has to be a new line."
12254460,12254860," All right."
12254860,12256940," So, this is basically what we have here."
12256940,12258060," We classify the folder."
12258060,12258760," And it will."
12258760,12260520," Yeah."
12260520,12262000," This will just do that for me."
12262000,12264420," Classify file."
12264420,12264880," Accept."
12264880,12266320," This kind of thing."
12266320,12269860," I mean, this is real-world Haskell for you."
12269860,12270400," What do you want?"
12270400,12274580," Classify."
12276180,12276620," Oh, yeah."
12276620,12277620," I need to do sm."
12277620,12281140," Spam."
12281140,12281700," Model."
12281700,12285180," And, classify."
12285180,12286300," Folder."
12286300,12289520," This is going to be ham."
12289520,12292440," And, get ready."
12292440,12298520," We're classifying the first file in the ham folder."
12298520,12301280," Actually, this is not the first one."
12301280,12303660," But, it's one of them."
12305040,12306600," I wonder how much time it will take."
12306600,12307780," It takes a lot of time."
12307780,12309060," Because, um."
12309060,12312740," Maybe the file is too long."
12312740,12313620," Who knows?"
12313620,12317180," But, it's definitely ham."
12317180,12321640," Maybe you don't want to do this kind of things in."
12321640,12328700," Text has a snog fun."
12328700,12329940," Oh, it's like opposite of cons."
12329940,12332400," It's like opposite of cons."
12334960,12337840," So far, it works."
12337840,12341400," I think these ham files are too long."
12341400,12342340," That's what it feels like."
12342340,12343480," Not all of them."
12343480,12344480," Some of them are fast."
12344480,12349380," But, so far, it classifies them more or less correctly."
12349380,12352240," It's just too slow."
12352240,12353900," That's the only problem we have here."
12353900,12355600," Multi-threading when."
12355740,12357240," And, we can try to do that."
12357240,12357240," We can try to do that."
12357240,12364980," Imagine using off and look up instead of log entry map."
12364980,12365760," Well, we would."
12365760,12369240," Oh, shit."
12369240,12372200," It's killing my PC, I think."
12372200,12375120," I cannot control Emacs anymore."
12375120,12376580," Emacs is dead, by the way."
12380500,12383260," I wonder if the stream is still alive, but."
12383260,12386280," By the way, is the stream alive?"
12386280,12387460," But, Emacs is dead."
12387460,12389040," I don't know why is it so dead."
12393880,12394320," Okay."
12394320,12397220," That's strange."
12397220,12401800," I think, I think Emacs is just, you know, going crazy."
12401800,12402940," I don't know what the fuck is going on."
12402940,12403860," Okay."
12403860,12405180," This is one of the things we can do."
12405260,12434440," SpamModel and classify folder SM and can I do something like data validate ham and maybe in here it will work a little bit faster."
12434440,12437960," Or, at least it's not going to be dead super soon."
12437960,12440240," Yeah."
12440240,12443540," But, to be fair, I think this is a success, pretty much."
12443540,12447400," We're capable of validating them."
12447400,12449160," It's just generally too slow."
12449160,12452620," And, I'm not even sure how can we speed it up."
12452620,12454800," But, yeah."
12454800,12456280," That's pretty cool."
12456280,12458680," That's pretty cool."
12458680,12459340," I don't know why."
12463620,12470940," Interesting."
12470940,12480080," I don't understand how it works, how this entire formula works, but it works somehow."
12480940,12485560," It classifies the ham as ham so far."
12485560,12487660," XKCD."
12487660,12488760," What is that?"
12488760,12489480," Compiling."
12489480,12490540," Well, we're not compiling."
12490540,12491120," We're waiting."
12491120,12492740," We're validating our model."
12492740,12493500," That's what we're doing."
12493500,12498700," Did you cut your hair only with a clipper or with anything else?"
12501260,12504440," I actually used Razorblade."
12504440,12508080," Okay."
12508080,12514440," All right."
12514440,12514920," I get it."
12514920,12517000," So, what about spam?"
12517000,12518560," What about spam?"
12518560,12520760," Can we classify reliably spam?"
12522980,12524760," Yeah."
12524760,12527000," So, it classifies the spam pretty reliably."
12548660,12549920," This is a success."
12549920,12554840," We lost like 20 people, but this is still a success, I think."
12554840,12558000," It's slow, right?"
12558000,12562000," But, I think speeding this thing up is a completely separate task."
12562000,12566160," And, I'm not really sure why exactly it is slow."
12566860,12571300," But, it reliably classifies the spam in ham."
12571300,12573160," At least, like, for three."
12573160,12573400," Yeah."
12573400,12575440," You see, it reliably classifies them."
12575440,12576760," And, that's kind of cool."
12576760,12579460," Yeah."
12579460,12582040," It works."
12582040,12584660," So, yeah."
12584660,12585640," This is success."
12585640,12589040," I'm calling this a success, even though it turned out very slow."
12589180,12597380," But, I think making it faster has nothing to do with the original goal of learning how to do this kind of thing."
12597380,12599340," Yeah."
12599340,12605420," So, I'm going to just go ahead and commit whatever we have."
12605420,12607140," I'm not going to commit the data."
12607140,12607920," Oh, shit."
12607920,12608300," The data."
12608300,12609780," Like, there's a lot of data here."
12609780,12610860," That is not really wanted."
12615260,12619100," So, what I need to commit here is main.hs."
12619100,12621680," Oh, shit."
12621680,12623140," Oh, my God."
12623140,12623680," Okay."
12623680,12627940," I need to have too much data."
12627940,12628980," Okay."
12628980,12631080," Let me remove the data folder."
12631080,12634200," I'm literally removing the data folder."
12634200,12636140," So, then."
12636140,12639080," So, there is this thing."
12639080,12642640," And, there is that thing."
12643420,12646540," So, and everything else can be discarded."
12646540,12648080," So, no."
12648080,12648540," No."
12648540,12649400," Emacs."
12649400,12650560," Just fucking."
12650560,12652300," What the fuck are you showing me?"
12652300,12653300," I don't want to see that."
12653300,12654100," All right."
12654100,12655320," I just want to double check."
12655320,12660340," Working with a lot of data in Emacs is huge."
12660340,12661180," Pain in the ass."
12661180,12662120," Oh, my God."
12662120,12663120," Okay."
12663120,12664600," So, here's that."
12664600,12665560," Here's that."
12665560,12668100," All right."
12668100,12671520," First implementation of the classifier."
12673120,12678420," Final working implementation of the classifier."
12678420,12684480," I wish, like, I could commit all the data necessary for it to work."
12684480,12686000," But, there's just too much data."
12686000,12687200," It requires too much data."
12687200,12689240," So, I cannot really commit that."
12689240,12691420," But, I think it is working."
12691420,12693140," It is just fucking working."
12693140,12695000," I think that's amazing."
12695000,12697100," Yeah."
12697340,12700000," So, and you can find the source code of this thing here, if you're interested."
12700000,12702820," I did my best to implement that."
12702820,12711500," The only thing that I used to implement, to, like, understand how to implement that is these two articles, I think."
12714500,12715420," Oh, shit."
12715420,12716020," I'm an idiot."
12716020,12719800," I should have actually..."
12719800,12721940," My references are so bad."
12721940,12724420," So, this is not what I wanted to replace."
12724420,12725860," I wanted to..."
12725860,12729540," Replace it like this."
12729540,12731080," And then like this."
12731080,12731740," So, yeah."
12732000,12738460," The only two articles that I used are these two."
12738460,12742440," So, they're going to be available in the reference in the source code."
12742440,12743720," But, the main one is this one."
12744640,12744860," All right."
12744860,12746680," So, that's cool."
12746680,12749780," Fix references."
12749780,12752800," I'm going to push that right into the repo."
12752800,12755820," And, again, you can find the source code here, if you're interested."
12755820,12757300," All right."
12757300,12760120," So, you guys wanted a little bit of Haskell."
12760120,12760780," There you go."
12760780,12762460," Here's some Haskell for you."
12762460,12768180," Unfortunately, I don't really have time or energy to do Advent of Code."
12768180,12772520," So, we're going to do Advent of Code tomorrow first."
12772520,12773020," Right."
12773360,12778040," So, we're going to solve day 10 and maybe then 10, day 11."
12778040,12779240," We'll see how it goes."
12779240,12783040," But, unfortunately, it is time for me to go, boys and girls."
12783040,12785920," I hope today's stream was interesting."
12785920,12790560," It's kind of difficult to make such streams interesting because we're talking about, like,"
12790560,12795220," you know, very mathy topic, which people are very scared of."
12795220,12800200," And also using mathy language, which, again, people are scared of even more."
12800520,12805520," But I hope for those of you who are interested in these kind of topics, it was interesting."
12806400,12808640," But, unfortunately, it is time for me to go."
12808640,12810880," Thanks, everyone, who's watching me right now."
12811280,12812300," I really appreciate that."
12812300,12813200," Have a good one."
12813200,12816160," And I'll see you tomorrow, tomorrow, according to the schedule."
12817160,12819560," We are doing game development in C++."
12819560,12822920," We're going to continue developing our game that we've been developing for a year."
12822920,12828920," Also, check out the schedule for more information on different projects we're working on."
12828920,12833840," We're working on several projects simultaneously on the different days."
12833840,12839240," And also check out our VOTS channel, where we archive our streams."
12839240,12841460," This stream is going to be there, but tomorrow."
12841460,12842980," We upload them on the next day."
12842980,12846960," And also check out our Discord server for offline discussion with the community."
12846960,12848840," And that's it."
12848840,12850380," That's it for today, boys and girls."
12850380,12851360," Love you."
12851360,12852360," Love you."
