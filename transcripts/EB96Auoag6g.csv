240,7440," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another recreational programming session"
7440,13840," with Azuisin uh so let's make a little bit of announcement and officially start the stream as"
13840,23200," usual as usual uh so we're gonna do a red a circle uh live on twitch and what are we doing today on"
23200,32640," twitch.a television website so today we're doing windows development on linux that's right uh today"
32640,37200," is going to be the legendary stream that i've never done before i've never done anything like that"
37200,44080," before uh but we're gonna do that right so we're gonna be doing a windows development on linux so"
44080,50480," and i can hear you asking but zozin why would you do a development for this niche operating system for"
50480,57440," video games and stuff like that well i'll tell you right so i was working on my mutualizer right so"
57440,62400," the thing uh that we can visualize the music and produce high quality videos and stuff like that"
62400,68000," in fact i can show you how this entire looks like it actually looks pretty cool i'm super proud of this"
68000,75360," thing in fact i didn't know that i can produce such a cool looking results uh right this looks like it"
75360,80880," was created by an artist but then they look back to it and i was who created it it's just like so"
80880,88720," bizarre sometimes right so i'm super proud of this thing uh right so looks how it looks like so freaking"
88720,93920," awesome and then you can press f and it will start rendering the video right it will take some time so"
93920,98640," we're not going to do a full video so i'm going to just close it right away but yeah so uh if you want"
98640,105440," to watch how the final video looks like uh you can watch it on um you know on the github page right so"
105440,110160," you can watch it in here so i'm going to copy paste the source code to this thing uh to the chat and for"
110160,116480," people who are watching on youtube of course it is going to be in the description as usual as usual so"
116480,125280," here it is uh so um i basically upload it to github i publish the source code and then weird comments"
125280,130640," start to roll in things like but where is the windows support so you know when you're gonna do"
130640,137520," a windows port windows windows windows windows windows it's just like who still uses this niche"
137520,145200," operating system for video games in 2023 and apparently like i didn't freaking know that apparently there's"
145200,152160," like a huge community of people who still use that operating system like holy and apparently"
152160,158800," like i i have to actually port my programs to this weird operating system specifically designed for"
158800,165120," video games like i don't know why people don't use like a real operating systems right designed for"
165120,170720," real serious professional work why they're using operating system for silly video games i do not"
170720,175040," understand it's kind of weird to me but i mean i i don't judge right i don't judge"
175040,179440," if a lot of people chose this weird operating system for video games as the main operating system"
179440,186240," so be it so we'll have to port uh our mutualizer to windows as well"
186240,194080," so anyway obviously i'm joking right so just a disclaimer right so this is just a joke right"
194080,200800," because i actually seen people take my stance on you know niche uh operating system for video games too"
200800,206080," seriously like i'm obviously joking right i know it's the most used operating system on desktop i know"
206080,211520," that okay i'm not that dumb i'm not the smartest person on planet earth but i'm not that dumb"
211520,217840," okay right so anyway uh we need to have a windows support obviously right so because i want this"
217840,223360," application to be cross-platform and we're using primarily cross-platform dependencies so it should be"
223360,230400," relatively doable um right so the problem is i do not have windows well i do have windows on this machine"
230400,238640," actually i have windows 8 but uh setting up a streaming um things on that um operating system is"
238640,245120," kind of pain in ass look i did i didn't i didn't want to spend time on that so i decided uh what if i just"
245120,253280," try to port it to windows on linux by cross-compiling using min.gw you guys know what is a min.gw so"
253280,261120," it's actually a pretty cool project uh min.gw is basically a port of gcc uh that basically generates"
261120,265760," uh windows code i don't know why it's source code but there was a official website yeah this one i think i"
265760,272640," think that's the official website of min.gw so uh it's an advancement of the original min.gw oh so it's"
272640,277520," sort of like a min.gw2 electric boogaloo uh well"
277520,282400," well that's an advancement for sure"
282400,289760," just having a working website is already advancement of a previous version i do agree with that anyway"
289760,297040," so uh right and essentially what they did they ported gcc compiler to actually target windows system"
298160,304240," right so they now target windows systems as well and what's interesting is that this compiler since"
304240,311520," it targets windows system and generates like windows code but it's original gcc it can actually work on"
311520,317040," linux as well right so if you take a look at the downloads you will see not only windows like mcs i"
317040,324720," think mcs sort of like a distribution that comes with min.gw but you also see a linux right so essentially"
325280,334240," you can have a windows compiler windows compiler running on linux right so that's what you can do"
334240,341440," with min.gw so sitting on linux you can write windows code you can literally do include windows dot"
341440,349680," h right so you can literally do let me show you main let's see you can do include windows dot h and then the famous"
349680,355360," do you guys do you guys know this one win32 lin and min you can do this kind of crazy windows"
355360,362720," right this you usually do on the operating system for video games and sitting on linux you can compile it for windows"
362720,370640," oh yeah yeah so there's also i forgot about this like no min max i i don't know do you just do define no min max"
370640,376640," i don't remember i remember how to define it but i do remember uh something about min max right that collides with the standard min max"
376640,385600," standard min max so it's like yeah it's a mess windows api is a mess but to be fair it is as much of a mess as"
385600,394480," posix i feel like both posix and win api they're both mess but they're mess in a different way you know what"
394480,401680," i mean right so they're both kind of messy but slightly differently uh right and you can do like"
401680,411760," shot like that um so and you can compile it and you can produce actual pe executable on linux do you guys"
411760,421840," know what is a pe uh right so there is such thing as pe and there is such thing as adv right pe stands for i"
421840,429440," think it stands for portable executable right uh executable and elf stands for executable"
429440,437920," and linkable format right so both of these formats both of these formats they are designed for the same"
437920,445840," thing they are designed to hold the you know native instructions for executing so basically their format of"
445840,450720," the executable files that you run when you double clicking them so the only difference between them is"
450720,461440," that pe is for windows right so it's a windows and elf is for linux in fact it's for any unix posix uh and"
461440,470240," whatnot right so i think it's more it since it's supported primarily by unixes it's more widespread than pe right"
470240,476960," but but but in any case uh p is the windows executable format and elf is the linux unix posix executable"
476960,483680," format so as far as no macros and linux both use that format uh so anyway so and essentially uh you"
483680,492560," can take this program on linux and by calling mingw you can produce pe executable right you can produce"
492560,500080," the pe executable so and uh what i did i actually installed mingw and they actually come with this"
500080,505760," standard um in the standard repo of debian but the problem with mingw is that all its executable have"
506320,515040," um weird ass naming scheme that i can never fucking remember right it is so fucking painful the thing i"
515040,521360," have to do i have to go to user bin all right and essentially do ls and grab a grab for mingw"
523360,533280," ah yes x86 64 w64 mingw 32 g plus yeah yeah that one yeah so this is the executable that you need to go"
533280,543600," uh you see what i'm talking about right so uh essentially let's give it a try x86 64 um"
543600,551840," w64 mingw 32 uh a lot of numbers in here as you can see and i think we have to call gcc"
551840,558000," uh right there we go so it acts like gcc uh and it even says no input files and stuff like that"
558000,563360," so let's actually try to uh compile our application our windows application that"
563360,567040," include windows dos h and stuff like that with mingw 32."
567040,575120," okay so it complains that we didn't include stdio okay that's fine we can include stdio"
578000,582320," wait wait wait wait wait wait a freaking second"
582320,585680," linux"
585680,596960," what what the is going on the world is going crazy what the this is a this this should not be possible"
596960,601920," this this computer is haunted it's possessed it's"
603440,607280," but in any case look what it produced"
607280,610800," look what it produced"
610800,618320," now let's go ahead and do a file on this"
618320,628880," and if i try to run it"
628880,634320," i can't run it because it's not a real linux executable"
634320,642800," but if this is a real windows executable i should be able to run it with wine right so what if i do wine"
647600,657280," so you on linux you can actually write like a real windows application and produce real windows"
657280,663360," executable with mingw and if you want to test them you can just use wine"
663360,670800," who needs windows for developing windows am i right like you don't even need windows to develop for windows"
670800,675360," anymore like why the fuck do you need that like you can just use mingw plus wine"
675360,677760," if you want to test your that's simple as that"
677760,682480," and that's exactly what we're going to do today"
682480,684560," are you guys ready"
684560,691200," i don't even know if it's going to work for mutualizer to be fair right so i don't know what's the limits"
691200,692880," of this approach"
692880,696800," right because obviously it is limited right so"
697280,700960," uh i'm pretty sure there's some things that you cannot do in here"
700960,704480," but i have a feeling that this is a pretty good bottom line"
704480,708880," i have a feeling i don't have a proof for that evidence or anything like that"
708880,716080," but i have a feeling that if your application works on such a shady platform as mingw plus wine"
716080,722560," it will probably work on windows maybe we don't really know i don't know how much how many discrepancies"
722560,728800," there are between windows and and wine and midgw and stuff like that but we can at least try right"
728800,733120," so by the way i'm not claiming that this is like more superior development environment than windows or"
733120,738720," anything like that literally the only reason i'm doing it like that is that i could not be bothered to"
738720,744640," set up windows environment that's literally the only reasons like i don't have like some some hot take"
744640,750320," on linux versus windows i literally don't give a shit i hate all the operating systems equally like"
750320,756160," everything i say about like windows versus linux is just a joke to piss people off i personally don't"
756160,761040," give a fuck literally the only reason why i'm doing it like that i could not be fucking bothered to just"
761040,766720," set up windows i'm sorry if i just already had the windows environment set up i would just stream from"
766720,772480," windows but i just don't don't want to fucking do that right so don't expect any hot takes on that"
772480,776080," shit from me just like i'm too lazy uh right"
776080,783520," yeah and but but that's not a very interesting windows application"
783520,793440," this is this is not a hello world of windows what would be a real hello world of windows windows"
793440,802960," developers tell me what is the real hello world of windows of winap yes yeah instantly message box a or"
802960,808720," just message box i think we can just use a message box uh right so let's do a message box can we do a"
808720,818160," message box on linux uh right so let me see let me see uh okay so let's just literally call windows message"
818160,827760," a box instead of this unix scheisse imagine like programming for unix in 2023 ew ew unix ew"
827760,833040," anyway so if i remember correctly this is the parent window we don't really have a parent window we have"
833040,840880," to say like null in here right so we don't have that so here we have to say hello world and this is a caption"
840880,846240," right so for caption let's say hi and the type if i remember correctly what's your type i think it's"
846240,851680," like buttons that can be available yeah yeah so whether it's going to have okay okay cancel yes no"
851680,855280," we don't really care about this stuff so as far as no we can just put zero in here"
855280,860400," uh right so and it returns an error or whatnot we can just like remove it and because of that we don't"
860400,863920," really need std iom so what if i try to compile this into anything"
863920,875280," i swear to god this is cursed like you're you are on linux and you're doing this kind of and it just"
875280,883840," works it's bizarre like i can't i can't get over it like why does it work why does it work and okay let's"
883840,887680," take a look main.exe"
887680,896400," who needs windows who needs this niche operating system for video games"
896400,903040," look at me yeah there is you you have windows like this is a message box so the hello world okay"
903040,904960," you press okay and it's just like there you go"
908000,916320," you can develop windows application just just fine just use mingw and run it with wine but to be fair"
916320,923520," like i literally have no idea if i just take this executable and copy it to windows machine will i be"
923520,928640," able to run it i literally have no idea maybe it won't work maybe the only environment it can work is"
928640,935440," wine uh that would be interesting is that a common case when there is some windows application that works"
935440,941040," only in wine but doesn't work on linux because usually it's the other way around right so it"
941040,945200," usually works on windows but doesn't work in one because wine doesn't implement anything how many"
945200,952240," situations there is like that so i i suppose from from the chat what i can see is that it's pretty"
952240,959600," rare right so it is in fact pretty rare so yes yes yes so so for mingw mingw is usually available on"
959600,964640," all of the like linux distributions like you can just do apt install or whatever you use you use like"
964640,970160," uh arch probably right so pacman uh right so it's usually available and you should be able to create"
970160,974960," like a windows executable and one is also available so it's just like a pretty interesting sort of"
974960,980640," development environment mingw plus wine so and i'm i suppose i'm going to put all these things in the"
980640,988720," description just in case for anyone who's interested in this kind of stuff right so this is mingw and wine"
992560,1000880," i swear to god i swear to god i feel like um this development environment like wine in general is"
1000880,1008080," getting better and better and better and some point and at some point the uh developers of wine are going"
1008080,1014880," to be better at windows development than microsoft itself and the microsoft will say well it would be"
1014880,1020720," cheaper to just like let those guys do all this windows compatibility development and just turn windows"
1020720,1026800," operating system into the linux distro they may actually do that at some point this is literally"
1026800,1032880," what they did with internet explorer right so within the internet explorer at some point they realized oh"
1032880,1039760," like google is much better at doing this kind of than us so let's just like let google do all of the"
1039760,1044560," uh web engine stuff and they replace it with edge which is basically chrome at some point they're"
1044560,1048640," going to realize that with operating system as well they're going to say well we're we forgot how to"
1048640,1054000," develop operating system let's let the community do the thing and turn windows into a linux distribution"
1054000,1059840," i can actually see that happening so there is a lot of steps that go towards like things like wsl"
1059840,1064880," they're slowly moving towards that so i have a strange feeling like but i'm not going to make any"
1064880,1073680," client but i have a feeling that at some point it might happen so because microsoft is slowly forgetting how"
1073680,1079040," to develop a rating system they already forgot how to develop uh web browsers they they know how to"
1079040,1083360," fucking do that like they forgot that and they actually admitted that and they're slowly forgetting"
1083360,1084880," how to make up a rating system so"
1096880,1104000," trillion dollar corporation by the way so anyway um essentially what i want to achieve right um at the"
1104000,1112160," end of this journey um i want um mutualizer to be actually just two executables on windows"
1112160,1120080," the first executable is going to be uh mutualizer um mutualizer dot exe and the second one is going to be"
1120080,1126960," ffm pack right and essentially on on windows you will just like uh double click mutualizer just pop"
1126960,1132000," some music in there you would uh press f to render the thing maybe we're going to have a better ui maybe"
1132000,1135680," we're going to have actual buttons on the screen but i need to think how we're going to organize all"
1135680,1141120," that and it will run this entire thing as a separate process right it's going to run this entire thing as"
1141120,1148960," a separate process and uh for windows we can just literally ship a zip archive uh jai compiler style"
1148960,1153920," um right that contains just these two executables uh luckily ffm pack is already compiled"
1153920,1160240," as a windows executable uh i already downloaded that by the way so i think i think i copied in here yeah"
1160240,1164320," there we go so uh let me let me see if you go to ffm pack"
1166720,1173600," if you go to ffm pack uh they have a download page right so but the developers of fm pack don't"
1173600,1178640," compile it for windows themselves they actually rely on somebody else doing that so as far as"
1178640,1185760," now there's two providers for ffm pack i downloaded this one uh gndef right so this is basically ffm pack"
1185760,1190960," for windows like binaries and stuff like that and what's interesting is that they work really well even"
1190960,1197440," on wine yeah so ffm pack compiled for windows works in wine and it like converts videos and"
1197440,1204640," stuff like that and it's just like actually pretty amazing not gonna lie uh right uh ffm pack binaries"
1204640,1210640," for windows right so this is where i'm gonna copy paste this entire stuff for anyone who's interested so"
1210640,1216480," uh yeah here's it is in the chat so that's the technologies we're going to be using i'm actually"
1216480,1221840," really curious so what if i just like unpack uh this entire thing so let me demonstrate you how good it"
1221840,1229280," is um so the entire thing the entire distribution here doesn't really contain much right if i just just"
1229280,1235520," do find uh there is a lot of like html documentation right so we can just skip that there's some presets"
1235520,1240640," i don't know what the they are but there is three executables in here like ffprop that just prints"
1240640,1246480," information about the uh audio or the video ffm pack the the converter and ff play is some sort of"
1246480,1252560," a player i think i used it once uh the cool feature of that player is that it shows the sound wave right"
1252560,1258080," so it's it's useful for that right but we only have ffm pack in here so and we can literally just try"
1258080,1267200," to do one ffm pack and uh does it work does it work it does in fact work so it is very important for us"
1267200,1273840," so it works in wine because we're going to be testing it uh through wine as well right we're going"
1273840,1280320," to be testing the whole sort of like a pipeline uh right somebody says wine os uh yeah it is actually"
1280320,1287600," kind of cool um wine feels like a small subsystem of windows on your linux machine i i'm going to tell"
1287600,1292640," i'm going to show you right one of the things you can do with wine you can do wine cmd guess what this"
1292640,1306640," thing does so you can go to c drive right you can go to c drive you have program files program files"
1306640,1314400," exit is uh 86 you have users and stuff like that right so you can go to users uh so among the users"
1314400,1321280," you have the streamer okay so that's that's me and you have my documents my music uh application"
1321280,1326640," data and stuff like that so for instance you want to do notepad main.c right"
1336000,1345440," this is just wine this is just what comes with wine right so so you can develop some programs in here"
1345440,1350800," uh so but what's interesting is that this notepad i feel like they re-implemented it from scratch"
1350800,1354960," because obviously they cannot use whatever comes from the actual windows because that's like a"
1354960,1359280," copyright and stuff like that so for these kind of like components of the operating system they"
1359280,1367680," re-implemented them themselves and uh furthermore uh you can do explorer right and uh it's their"
1367680,1373680," version of explorer right so basically they implemented their own explorer i suppose they implemented these"
1373680,1382160," sort of like basic commands of windows in case you want to run some uh batch scripts that call to these"
1382160,1386000," commands and stuff like that right so that's probably why they implemented it but they had to implement it"
1386000,1391280," from scratch right this doesn't look like a windows explorer at all right but it kind of like replaces"
1391280,1399360," it right so you can think of wine as just like a small subsystem of windows on linux it's kind of"
1399360,1406400," weird but it it makes sense at the same time right so yeah it's it's interesting it's interesting right"
1407520,1422960," so uh right right right right so um yes i think the time has come to actually try uh and at least try to"
1422960,1432080," compile um mutualizer with min gw right just to see where we can go from that from there right so let's go to"
1432080,1440640," visualizer uh and uh so what we're going to do let me find the the compiler so here is the compiler"
1440640,1447680," so do i have a hot reloading uh right now enabling i think i think i do have it right if i do echo"
1447680,1454720," hot reload uh it's gonna say yeah so hot reloading is enabled i want to disable hot reloading so let me"
1455360,1463440," actually restart uh this entire style so i'm gonna go to visualizer uh if i do hot reload it"
1463440,1471200," hot reload you know so you unset the variables in bash with unset if i remember correctly right so hot"
1471200,1479120," reload and if i do something like that okay so it's not set anymore i can restart the emacs and if i try to"
1479120,1485520," run build.sh uh okay it doesn't build dll anymore so it is not built in the hot reloading mode which is"
1485520,1493040," perfect right i'm super happy with that uh okay so i'm going to command out this specific line right i'm"
1493040,1498000," going to command out this specific line uh one of the things i'm going to do i'm going to replace clang"
1498000,1510160," with um you know x86 64 w64 min gw32 gcc yo i think i'm starting to remember uh right so we're going"
1510160,1518240," to provide exe uh we're only going to provide the c files and nothing else right so i want to just try to"
1518240,1525360," compile uh it like that and see where exactly it is going to fail so interestingly we provide the linux"
1525360,1530880," implementation of ffm pack and linux implementation of fm pack actually uses a lot of linux specific"
1530880,1535680," things so it might not compile for windows but anyway uh let's just give it a try and see how it"
1535680,1544800," goes uh okay so it tries to uh like use ray leap um we can provide the headers from uh for ray leap it's"
1544800,1551920," not that big of a deal uh in fact yeah we can just like we can just provide the flags and see how it's"
1551920,1558080," going to go right so let's just provide the flags for array leap um and there we go so if the first"
1558080,1563440," thing it fails at is the linux stuff right it's the linux stuff and this is literally why i want you to"
1563440,1570160," keep all of the linux things in a separate translation unit so uh the interface looks like this but then i"
1570160,1576320," can have several implementations of of that interface specifically this one is for linux and then we can"
1576320,1585200," easily create ffm pack windows right and just implement all of these functions for windows right"
1585200,1592400," and we i kind of already do know how to implement this kind of stuff for windows because this is"
1592400,1598880," something that i've already done before i already uh i already created a separate process on windows and"
1598880,1604720," then connected a pipe to it this is something that i've done before and i've done it in uh no build"
1604720,1611920," project right so which is a building uh building tool for for c right so uh it's somewhere here right"
1611920,1616320," if anyone is interested i'm going to actually copy paste it here in the chat and for people on youtube"
1616320,1622880," of course it's going to be in the description uh in the description so if i take a look at no build.h"
1623920,1633520," so um there is a call to function create process in there uh pro um i think i'm going crazy okay so"
1633520,1640720," create process so and it's done in the context of running a separate process synchronously right and"
1640720,1649280," what's cool here is that uh this function can accept opened files for standard input and standard output and"
1649280,1657280," the way you do that on windows is you actually fill this thing out in the start info uh structure right"
1657280,1662720," so they have fields for standard output standard input standard error and you literally can just"
1662720,1667760," open a file and assign this thing there and the new process is going to use those open file descriptors"
1667760,1673280," as the streams for standard input and standard output and that's way that way we can connect to fmpac on"
1673280,1679040," windows so we already have a knowledge on how to do that we already did a research right"
1679040,1684160," and it does work right because with this kind of thing we managed to pipe several commands together"
1684160,1690560," on windows right so we managed to pipe that so that should work with the fmpac as well maybe if"
1690560,1695440," everything goes well we'll actually test that on today's stream we have a fmpac executable we can"
1695440,1700800," just create process we just can pipe some frames into it and see how it works and all that through wine"
1700800,1704800," that would have been interesting i think right that would have been interesting"
1705600,1710400," but anyway for now i don't think i'm going to be uh implementing on any of these functions so the"
1710400,1716480," easiest thing i can do is just you know ignore them right i can return minus one saying that this"
1716480,1723840," indicating that this thing is not implemented so to avoid any uh sort of unused unused variable errors"
1723840,1729840," so i'm going to just do you do void uh avoid all these variables so fps and sound file path"
1729840,1736320," so maybe uh one of the things i will have to do i will have to do include std depth but i think if i"
1736320,1742240," just include ffmpeg h yeah this is something that should have been in ffmpeg h i think right so in"
1742240,1749600," here we just include ffmpeg h so and let's just go ahead and stub uh the rest of the functions so oh"
1749600,1757920," and by the way um maybe we'll have to replace what this function return because it makes sense on linux to"
1757920,1764080," return int because that's the file descriptor but we may have more complicated things on windows so maybe"
1764080,1770480," we're going to replace this integer with some sort of opaque pointer opaque type uh or pointer to opaque"
1770480,1774800," type right so and depending on the operating system it's going to point to different kind of structure"
1774800,1781520," that hold different kinds of um you know native specific things right so that's usually what people"
1781520,1787120," do on like on different operating systems and stuff like that but plus first platform development first"
1787120,1793760," platform development uh all right so and essentially now for windows specifically we're"
1793760,1799280," going to replace linux with windows it's that simple right so since we're building for for"
1799280,1805520," windows we're releasing that with windows okay you know what's weird this motherfucker compiled"
1805520,1818560," it didn't link but it freaking compiled i hate it why does it so why why did it just work well i mean"
1818560,1823440," yeah so now we have to spend some time like figuring out how we can link with"
1823440,1829760," all of that but it's already compiled right it's already compiled so i wonder if i just so it can"
1829760,1836640," work with the headers that are on my linux machine but i'm pretty sure if i just provide libs it's not"
1836640,1844560," going to really link well yeah right right right so it cannot find like raylib uh lgl of w and dl and"
1844560,1850880," stuff like that because like it's they are not in a format that can be linked for windows application"
1850880,1856960," right right right so when this is where the actual problems start to to occur but we can go ahead and"
1856960,1867360," maybe go to github array san raylib maybe ray san actually creates like um binaries for us for for"
1867360,1873200," windows we can doing some of this stuff so let's take a look at raylib uh that's a lot of text"
1874000,1893760," uh okay so um we are doing uh 64 bit application right so we're doing 64-bit application right so we're"
1893760,1901920," doing 64-bit application as far as i know in the windows terminology exit 664 is basically 64 bits uh and i feel like"
1901920,1911760," like 32 bits right 32 bits right 32 bits is actually i 686 yeah so it's it's more like a windows terminology"
1911760,1919360," do we want to build a 32-bit application by the way how common 32-bit applications are on windows"
1919360,1927200," on linux they're basically the the thing of the past they basically think of the past they don't nobody"
1927200,1934400," actually uh build them anymore uh they are common uncommon so people are sending me like mixed signals"
1934400,1941600," they are common okay so there is um you know the regular chatter the regular chatter that says they"
1941600,1947600," are common and there's a first time chatter instantly trying to debate me saying uncommon who do you think"
1947600,1951920," i'm going to trust more thank you by the way twitch for actually creating this frame thank you so much"
1952560,1960080," uh right so classic chat i can instantly see who's lying i can instantly see uh there are a lot still"
1960080,1969040," steam is still 32-bit really steam is still 32-bit oh yeah to be fair like if it was not a very common"
1969040,1975760," thing i'm pretty sure ray sun would have not provided 32-bit uh like binaries right uh but since we're"
1975760,1981520," trying to be modern and stuff like that we can try to um to build you know 64-bit so let's actually download"
1981520,1996880," 64-bit all right uh so let me maybe move uh this stuff move uh download array lib uh here so what do we"
1996880,2004560," have inside let's look inside so we have headers so we don't even have to use our local headers we can"
2004560,2010320," just use the headers from this thing and we have okay that that's pretty cool so we have static things"
2010320,2011520," and we have dynamic things"
2011520,2021120," not bad not bad at all uh all right so let me try the following thing so i'm going to literally unpack it"
2021120,2026400," right so we're going to put it in here and one of the things i want to try to do what if i try to use"
2026400,2032000," the headers from uh from that archive right so let's actually use the headers from that archive"
2032000,2039680," so to do that i think i'm gonna just copy paste uh these things in here all right so i'm gonna copy"
2039680,2048000," paste these things in here and i'm gonna say include uh this thing and i think it's just include right so"
2048000,2048880," yeah just include"
2052720,2061760," and let's remove these leaves and see how it is going to build now okay so the headers work the"
2061760,2074000," headers do work uh now i'm going to do the following thing i'm gonna do l search for the libraries uh search"
2074000,2084320," for the libraries in lib uh and link with radio so that's what we're going to try to do okay"
2091120,2103600," that is very interesting so uh time begin period time begin periods what is this function okay we're"
2103600,2112480," entering the linker hell the linker hell so oh yeah i remember that on windows you are supposed to like"
2112480,2122400," link with things like user 32 gdi 32 kernel 69 like you can just build your application you have to link"
2122400,2128880," with all these like weird components of windows and shit like that and it's just like apparently microsoft"
2128880,2133440," developers like get a kick out of you suffering with this kind of shit so you have to kind of like"
2134000,2137920," you know um you know play by the rules um"
2137920,2147440," oh win mm lib i wonder if mean gw actually like comes with this kind of stuff can i just do like l"
2147440,2150720," uh a win mm right can you do shit like that"
2150720,2157520," i think i think i can at least i didn't compare so what if i provide some in here"
2158240,2164560," okay you cannot provide bullshit in here so this is literally something that exists in min gw okay"
2164560,2172240," and if you don't include this kind of thing uh whether you have this time end and begin period"
2172240,2179280," and if you do include this entire thing um you don't have this shit anymore you don't have this shit"
2179280,2186960," anymore okay uh so by the way i remember that there was one person who been constantly"
2187840,2195840," uh committing build scripts for min gw uh right so for for all of my projects and i really"
2195840,2200240," appreciate that unfortunately i don't really have that much time and resources to actually go through"
2200240,2206480," the pull request but at the times when i did there was one person who's been maintaining min gw bills"
2206480,2212320," for all my projects and it was so cool uh if you're watching right now thank you so much it's so freaking"
2212320,2217680," cool maybe we can steal some ideas from uh their scripts right so one of the projects that still"
2217680,2223520," has that is like a dead uh do you guys remember that right it's just it's this like epic you know"
2223520,2230240," text editor uh right so i'm gonna put the link to this thing in the description all right and it still"
2230240,2236880," has min gw built uh right we can steal some ideas from there right so the great artists they're still"
2236880,2245840," um oh people do remember that okay uh dramatic sex editors to be fair that is one of those things that"
2245840,2250800," are really difficult to forget right because it's a pretty cool it's a pretty cool project to be fair"
2250800,2255840," a lot of people keep asking me to get back to the development of this thing um i'll think about that"
2255840,2262240," i'll think about that i don't know i don't have a practical application for this text editor uh right"
2262240,2269120," so it's great for memes it is great for memes but what's the practical application of this project"
2269120,2276720," i don't freaking know i don't freaking know my man okay let's take a look at uh this script itself so"
2276720,2281680," what does it do what kind of libraries does it actually link with so this one is supposed to be"
2281680,2288720," run from windows by the way from windows but we are running our from linux and testing everything in"
2288720,2295440," windows so in any case both of these things are min gw anyway right so min gw just like ours is compiled"
2295440,2300080," for linux and theirs is compiled for windows but i suppose the flags should be pretty much the same"
2300080,2308960," um they're not really doing anything particularly special they're linking with things like opengl32"
2309520,2317600," and this is something that we may want to do as well um all right apart from that nothing nothing"
2317600,2327200," particularly special so there is packages uh so what is packages it is used for libs so interestingly"
2327200,2335520," they use static they use the flag static maybe this is one of the things that we have to do as well to be"
2335520,2344400," fair in all fairness uh it would be kind of cool if those two executables that i plan to ship um on"
2344400,2351360," windows right uh visualizer nff and back they were static they were not depending on any external dls or"
2351360,2356480," anything like that because like i want this thing to be like you just download this archive unpack it"
2356480,2362720," run it and it just works like it should like software should unfortunately it does not in 2023 but"
2362720,2368880," this is how software used to work for a long time um right so maybe this is something that we want to"
2368880,2378960," do as well just to do static uh so let's just try to build that stuff uh nah it doesn't right anyway"
2378960,2389120," whatever uh so we have this kind of thing right we have this kind of thing so where can we find imp w assert"
2391120,2396800," do we have to include some special things for but this is just an assert"
2396800,2405280," uh so is there any libraries that we have to link with"
2405280,2410880," you guys know what kind of libraries"
2412480,2420880," um um lib ms uh vcrt okay maybe this is what we have to do um"
2420880,2425280," lib ms vcrt so let's give it a try"
2425280,2427600," okay"
2427600,2439520," nah it didn't solve it so um there's things like create swap buffers this looks like gdi or something this looks"
2439520,2445280," like gdi maybe we can just fix the gdi linking linking problems yeah win gdi i vaguely remember"
2445280,2453200," this kind of stuff right so to be fair like um first at first i was programming for windows long time"
2453200,2458960," ago right so my first operating system was windows and i even started programming when i was on windows"
2458960,2465680," so i did a little bit over win 32 api development before i came to linux so i kind of vaguely remember"
2465680,2473600," that from my childhood right to me this is not something particularly new to me this is more like"
2473600,2478800," a call to to the past right so this is basically my childhood right"
2478800,2486000," so uh i'm not i'm no stranger to win api it's just like for me it was a very long time ago"
2486000,2495200," it was a very long time ago so these days i grown up i grew out of that"
2496080,2503840," niche operating system for video games i'm an adult i don't play video games anymore because video games"
2503840,2510720," are for children so i'm using a serious business separate joking by the way to take me seriously okay"
2510720,2518640," i do play video games by the way even on linux sometimes so anyway uh right so let me let me see"
2518640,2528960," can we just link with uh lgdi 32 uh okay okay that that's that's correct where is"
2528960,2539680," this is this is something that pisses me off on this line because this is just insert"
2541520,2548240," this is like it's not really that important over function but where the do i find it"
2548240,2555920," where the do i find it does anyone know where it is located can you just"
2555920,2566720," library for asserts yeah exactly library for asserts i need to find it where is that oh god damn it uh"
2566720,2568480," crates dot io"
2568480,2575920," i'm going to show you the the pinnacle of rust development my favorite one these"
2575920,2578560," motherfuckers put error no to a separate library"
2578560,2591360," freaking they couldn't you won't believe like i even found a lot of discussions on how to treat error no"
2592240,2598480," they couldn't agree whether to put error no in lipc package or not lipc package because it looks"
2598480,2603440," out of place because in rust you cannot have global variables and because of that you can only implement"
2603440,2611920," error no as set ever no and get error no right so yeah so there is error no location but from the"
2611920,2618160," from the name point of view like how do you call that if you don't call it just error no that means it's not"
2618160,2623200," lipc anymore it's something inspired by lipc but not really lipc and there was like a huge like"
2623200,2628720," thousand comments discussion on how to treat all of that and they finally decided where to put"
2628720,2634880," that eight byte locations of memory they decided to put that eight byte locations of memory to a separate"
2634880,2641840," package after thousands of comments of discussion they finally agreed upon that this is the pinnacle of rust"
2641840,2651440," development and the same vibes i get from uh from assert right so like where do we put assert is that a"
2651440,2656160," separate package is not a separate separate package i don't freaking know uh so"
2660160,2663280," cross-platform interface to eight bytes of data exactly"
2663280,2670080," anyway whatever"
2670080,2682800," oh and by the way yeah this package is not small this package is not small because also depending on the"
2682800,2689200," platform you get this eight byte location to memory differently right so you get it differently so"
2689200,2693920," because of that there is a lot of code that tries to handle that and everything it's just holy"
2693920,2697120," fucking shit mine in front uh yeah"
2697120,2704880," fucking unix wazi and windows it's just a fucking miserable dude"
2704880,2708880," i don't even look into that anyway so"
2710800,2715920," um you know what"
2715920,2719520," fuck you listen in"
2719520,2737440," fuck you anyways"
2740800,2747440," so um it seems to be working we we compiled it"
2747440,2752880," why do you know we have to link with the glfw that's that's a bit weird"
2752880,2763600," can you just do nm on this library i can do nm like wait why why the"
2763600,2768480," what the fuck can i do nm"
2768480,2772160," this is a windows static binary"
2772160,2777760," why can i use linux bin utils on a windows"
2777760,2781600," is that because of it's it's a gcc"
2781600,2786560," wait don't don't freaking tell me that gcc uses"
2787440,2790720," linux formats for intermediate object byte code"
2790720,2793920," really"
2793920,2796880," does it"
2796880,2798640," it"
2798640,2804160," it freaking does it it literally uses like elf"
2804160,2806640," for intermediate object things"
2811760,2815280," what the fuck and that's why nm for me it just works so"
2815280,2817040," well i mean"
2817040,2820800," it's fucking cursed but at the same time can i"
2820800,2824240," uh okay so somebody suggests open it with ar"
2824240,2827040," how do you do ar i don't remember right just a second"
2827040,2829760," so do you do rx"
2829760,2831120," a"
2831120,2833280," okay"
2833280,2839440," so that's objects that we got from there right because dot a it's basically compressed together all files"
2839440,2841920," and if i take a look at the uh at the file of this thing"
2841920,2848560," cof object file intel and i don't know what is a cof object files"
2848560,2855120," is that the same as uh you know as whatever i get if i just do"
2855120,2856960," gcc"
2856960,2865040," foo dot c is that the same scheisse i get so if i just do file no it's f so the different"
2867920,2869040," cof is windows okay so"
2869040,2875520," but why does it work with nm then that that's bizarre am i not throwing that that's absolutely bizarre"
2875520,2877120," uh"
2877120,2882080," it works with maybe nm just supports cof"
2882080,2884640," and then linux"
2884640,2891360," from object files all right"
2895840,2900400," they didn't really mention that i guess they just support co for whatever freaking reason"
2900400,2905120," uh maybe it's it was not that that hard to implement maybe that's the point"
2905120,2914160," um okay whatever uh sure sure sure sure so let me just did all of that"
2914160,2918240," okay so what i want"
2920320,2921040," oh look at that"
2921040,2930720," ray leap literally includes glfw does it include like opengl and gl begin it also include"
2930720,2934160," rayson"
2934160,2942720," my compliments to the ship like seriously what the thank you"
2944800,2945520," what the fuck"
2945520,2951040," yeah thank you for including all of that into a single freaking library"
2951040,2958640," thank you so much okay so all right because i was already prepared to download glfw and stuff like"
2958640,2962240," it comes with that um why doesn't it come with assert"
2963840,2967680," oh it does come with assert wait a freaking second"
2967680,2972000," but it's not w assert"
2972000,2978480," what's the difference between w assert and just assert"
2978480,2985680," oh it's u and ah u isn't defined so you have to supply it so that means you also have to supply glfw"
2985680,2986320," yourself"
2986320,2986720," fuck"
2986720,2994160," fuck uh so w is a white strings on on linux"
2994160,3000880," i i can already sense with my ass the pain"
3000880,3005040," oh that was a mistake"
3005040,3007360," like why did they go into that"
3007360,3010640," anyway whatever uh so"
3011600,3015040," we have the executable so let's try to run this motherfucker"
3015040,3020480," uh i'm gonna do wine uh and we're gonna do main"
3020480,3026240," build mutualizer this is not what i want i want to do"
3026240,3027200," usualizer exe"
3027200,3036160," did i did i run the correct thing"
3036160,3039440," what the fuck is"
3041600,3047680," what the fuck wait can i"
3047680,3050160," come do this"
3050160,3056960," i must i must have run the linux version right so i must have"
3056960,3062640," must have run the linux version like this that could not be it uh build"
3062640,3066880," oh wait where is the like what the fuck is going on"
3066880,3088240," if i press f it went to a rendering video but does it render the video"
3088240,3096400," oh this is very interesting oh we don't check for it doesn't run ffmpag but we don't check for the ffmpag"
3096400,3096880," failure"
3096880,3106800," so one of the things we can do wait a second uh ffmpag start render we never check for that"
3106800,3114080," one of the things we can do plug ffmpag if it's less than zero we have to maybe print something"
3114080,3118240," we have to maybe print something so essentially maybe plug"
3119280,3119760," rendering error"
3119760,3121760," rendering error is going to be true"
3121760,3126240," uh so we have a rendering but then the rendering error"
3126240,3130000," uh so it's kind of a dumb way of doing that"
3130000,3133760," it's kind of a dumb way of doing that"
3133760,3140080," but we can do something maybe different just a second what if i go to windows"
3140080,3146240," i can do that right"
3146240,3154400," because that's going to be an ultimate test whether i actually run in windows version or not right"
3154400,3158720," lin and min uh and we can do the message box"
3158720,3168160," message box message box uh null um and we're going to say ffmpag rendering is not implemented"
3168160,3176240," for windows yet here it's going to be error and just like that just like that so that's going to be"
3176240,3195680," an ultimate test of whether we are running the correct version of this stuff uh right so let me give it a try"
3199680,3208640," why the fuck does it it actually okay so oh this is because the this thing blocks the main loop yeah so"
3208640,3213040," it even behaves like a windows look at that"
3213040,3216000," it even behaves like windows"
3216000,3226000," right it blocks the event loop right it blocks the event loop uh right and it keeps rendering the"
3226000,3228400," video because we don't really handle that error we just like print"
3229280,3231920," this is an actual windows application holy"
3231920,3236800," all right and we can try to take a look at this entire thing 2.3 megabytes"
3236800,3241040," compared to well but i mean it includes everything right so just like"
3241040,3245840," you know links everything and uh if we take a look at the file it's a p32"
3245840,3249200," plus x86 64 for mass windows"
3249200,3251760," yep"
3251760,3253920," yep"
3253920,3257760," it's too freaking easy"
3258880,3275200," we can already try to ship that so um yeah you know what uh that's pretty cool you know but we"
3275200,3280560," need to have support for ffm pack right so the next step is probably going to be"
3280560,3288720," trying to implement that idea of doing create process of ffm pack and establishing the pipe and stuff like"
3288720,3294560," that and see if we can do that on a smaller scale specifically we can go to this example that we did"
3294560,3300240," in the previous stream like a render video in c with ffm pack and just maybe extend it and add"
3300240,3305120," example that demonstrate how to do that on windows that would have been actually pretty cool uh this"
3305120,3312000," example by the way you can find this example on you know on on github so where it is uh render"
3312000,3317120," oh yeah here it is so i'm going to put this in the chat for people on youtube it's in the description"
3317120,3323520," right we can extend this example and um maybe at some point this could turn into a cross-platform"
3323520,3329520," library for running ffm pack as the separate process for rendering your own animations and stuff like"
3329520,3335440," that that would have been cool right so instead of like messing with create processes and stuff like"
3335440,3340960," that you will just take this small little library and it's going to work on linux i'm pretty sure it will"
3340960,3346480," already work on mac os because it's just post x right we're using post x here we'll work on windows"
3346480,3351920," and like everything um yeah that would have been would have been cool so this started as a simple"
3351920,3358400," example but it may turn into like an actual cross-platform library for just running uh running ffm pack as"
3358400,3366240," a child process and stuff like that that would have been cool uh yesu yesu yesu and we already have a"
3366240,3372640," ffp executable so we should be able to just like run it uh with create process but we will do that i"
3372640,3377760," think i need to make a small break chat i think we need a small break need to make a small break i need"
3377760,3383760," to refill my cup of tea uh right and after the break we're gonna continue doing all of that"
3383760,3391520," all right um all right so let's go ahead and see if we can actually run ffm pack as a separate process"
3391520,3398720," right so let's go back to uh this rendering video in c example right so we'll uh already have a ffm pack"
3398720,3405440," in here so let me take it here and maybe copy paste it on the same level as the the project itself"
3405440,3410240," so we have a ffm pack uh let's confirm that it's working right so i i want to make sure that it's"
3410240,3415360," working so it doesn't depend on any dll's that are near bar or anything like that it works by itself"
3415360,3423600," um it would be kind of nice to have something like ldd but for windows is there something like that does"
3423600,3433840," anybody know uh ldd for windows uh what is ldd for windows i remember i remember there was even like um"
3434640,3440720," like a gui application i forgot the name of it uh so"
3440720,3446160," ground of linux ldd on windows"
3446160,3449440," dump bin"
3449440,3462160," dependency what yes dependency walk can we run it on online okay there is okay so there is x64 so it's"
3462160,3472160," actually doing all 64. um i wonder yeah as far as i know like in wine in here if you do wine cmd you"
3472160,3480640," have cmd right the usual cmd uh and you have a c folder if i remember correctly um the c folder"
3480640,3487360," located in dot wine at home yeah there we go so drive c so essentially this is where it is located on linux"
3488080,3493040," so that folder in here it is located in here so it should be relatively straightforward to just"
3493040,3502800," copy some stuff some stuff in here i can uh maybe just go to download and let me find uh depends"
3502800,3511600," and i'm gonna just copy it there and i might as well just unpack it god damn it okay so freaking zip bomb"
3513360,3518640," those windows devs windows devs they never create like a separate inner folder like every time you"
3518640,3527920," unzip something that just like falls into your current folder which is um all right so can i do app data"
3529360,3534960," all right i need to go back in here is there something like home i think there was a home"
3534960,3545520," yeah no file anyway so um let me find uh depends okay depends can i now run"
3545520,3553920," freaking reflexes oh it's called user profile thank you thank you so much i i keep forgetting how to use"
3553920,3561600," windows like because i don't use windows daily so i don't really know uh right depends depends dot exe"
3561600,3572880," is it gonna work i wonder can i run it so it complains about something uh mfc 42 dll is not found oh okay"
3575840,3580640," who uses mfc in 2023 is that still a thing"
3580640,3589920," okay like we can't find it unfortunately anyway whatever uh doesn't really matter that much that"
3589920,3596320," will be interesting to look into the like dependencies and stuff like that yeah so a lot of like windows"
3596320,3604480," debugging tools can probably also work in wine okay anyway so let's focus on the on the real stuff on the"
3604480,3613920," actual things that we need to do so let's create main dot um windows right so we need that windows um"
3613920,3624400," i'm gonna maybe include just windows dot h and it's interesting how i don't have to create win main"
3626160,3636080," does mean gw automatically generates win main for you oh so that means that mutualizer may have an"
3636080,3645920," additional like a cmd window nearby it um so min gw gui applications i think you have to provide some"
3645920,3650800," sort of a flag so it doesn't do that uh i think there was something like that you guys remember"
3650800,3657840," okay except jesus"
3657840,3663360," i don't quite remember"
3663360,3671920," but maybe on oh okay so they create win like the entry point or themselves"
3672560,3676240," it was something like that okay whatever so i i can actually research that a little bit"
3676240,3681040," other so it doesn't really matter so far it works let's not solve problems that don't exist yet"
3681040,3688000," uh okay so let's go to no build and let's doing um a little bit of a code from there"
3688000,3697760," so maybe i have no build locally no builder no build dot h and let's find create process right so"
3697760,3705440," this is where we create for holy this is how much code you need to have to create a single process"
3705440,3712880," first you need to fill out the start info structure right then you have need to have a second structure"
3712880,3717760," called process info but you don't fill out anything there we just like zeroed out and then we have to"
3717760,3725440," call create process uh after that um we have to close handle h3 i don't really remember why the"
3725440,3732160," fuck we're doing that why this thing has h thread and h process what's the difference i don't remember"
3732160,3738800," um but anyway so that that's basically what we need to do in here uh so i'm gonna copy paste literally"
3738800,3744560," like everything in here and just hope for the best uh define win 32"
3746320,3759440," uh and let's just go ahead and build it so i'm gonna do x86 64 w64 manager w gcc o main windows"
3759440,3769280," main windows c let's compile it okay so let's go through the completionaries uh so here we are getting fd out"
3769280,3775120," these are only needed for the pipes so we're not going to do any pipes for now so we're going to only use the"
3775120,3782320," standard input and standard output i feel like if you don't really use the standard handles you don't"
3782320,3788400," really have to do that uh so if you just don't enable this flag and don't set any of these things"
3788400,3792960," i think it will just pick up the standard input output automatically but just in case i'm going"
3792960,3796640," to still do that right just in case i'm going to still do that because i vaguely remember what you have"
3796640,3804160," to put in here um right so this one has no concerns in here so and this is where we have to provide the"
3804160,3812320," command line right so here we can move up with ffmpec uh xz and that's it right that creates the process"
3812320,3817840," that essentially creates the process um so then we check whether it was successful or not then we close"
3817840,3823680," then we close this i don't think i don't know why we have to close it in here uh and here we essentially"
3823680,3833360," get the process itself so it would be nice to know the definition of startup in four uh can i take a look"
3833360,3848720," at the definition can i find it search for uh okay start up in four yeah yeah so it's it's probably handle"
3848720,3853280," but where's the process let me see it uh h"
3853280,3862480," process where where is the pi oh it's a process information dummy dumb dumb"
3863520,3871440," uh-huh so okay process information structure i feel like a real windows developer to be fair"
3871440,3878960," like i'm using msdn and i'm like with like with a smart face i'm looking through the computation okay"
3878960,3886320," so it's just protestant for structure yes yes yes like this yeah yeah yeah i'm a low level windows"
3886320,3892800," developer i know how to make game engines yes i i make a lot of money in a game developer com i know all"
3892800,3897200," this stuff none of you clubs know anything about yes yes yes windows API"
3897200,3904400," oh so all of that is handled right so um"
3904400,3914960," i just want to say that in here uh and i need to wait on this thing"
3914960,3922240," right i need to wait on this thing uh and if i remember correctly um so this is a cross-platform"
3922240,3926880," cross-platform process starting in no build specifically and it's actually kind of cool"
3926880,3933760," so you see if it's windows it uses that stuff windows craziness if it's linux it uses like the the postex fork"
3933760,3940880," and uh you know um exec and everything like that so there's also cross-platform i think weight uh which"
3940880,3947120," weights on the process yeah p the weight uh right and you see on windows it does this windows craziness on"
3947120,3953520," on linux it does this you know linux craziness so in here we're actually waiting for the pid"
3953520,3957920," okay that's pretty cool so you're waiting for the pid and then you're checking like different"
3957920,3963040," results and stuff like that and then we're taking the exit code and oh that's actually pretty cool so"
3963040,3968400," depending on the exit code we can just like actually return uh that exit code specifically so"
3968400,3977280," that's pretty cool i can copy paste that stuff in here as well and uh they're calling process speed"
3977280,3982880," so that means i can just say okay this is pithin all right so this is everything that we need probably"
3982880,3986960," but we're creating a separate process and we're just starting it it's probably not going to compile so"
3986960,3993760," let's actually go to the compilation errors and stuff like that uh panic oh it's a it's a no build"
3993760,3999360," specific function so maybe instead of that we're going to do f std error so this is going to be error"
3999360,4010000," and here we have the same you show we don't really have to show the commands so let's not do that"
4010000,4020640," let's get last error as string uh and then here we're going to just exit with uh one okay uh so the next"
4020640,4030720," compilation the next compilation error so we need to include stdio that's very cool uh what else get"
4030720,4037520," last error as string so do you have something like that um okay search"
4037520,4043040," wait what is this"
4045840,4050000," am i am i oh i'm actually wait is that a custom thing"
4050000,4058720," oh i remember that i stole it from the stack overflow okay so what it does it basically gets the message"
4058720,4065680," of the last error or something like that yeah so for the convenience okay so that's the additional"
4065680,4074080," thing we need to have in here uh there we go you won't believe how much pain and tears went into"
4074080,4080640," coming up with these pieces of code right and that's literally why i'm copy pasting them right i don't"
4080640,4087040," want to go through the same same hell again thank you very much i already researched all that i put that"
4087040,4092960," knowledge into into my project and now every time i need to do that i just grab and copy paste it no thank"
4092960,4096560," thank you very much i want to go through that ever again so"
4096560,4104240," yes this is how you create a separate process on windows yes"
4104240,4110880," surprisingly it was rather successful i'm surprised that i managed to successfully do that"
4110880,4119120," um so uh what else do we have assert yeah okay so let's include assert i remember we had problems with"
4119120,4129440," assert though um panic yet another panic okay again so i'm thinking i'm thinking can i just do some epic"
4129440,4136000," shy select f print f std error then error and then"
4136000,4145040," uh okay whatever then just return one but we should not forget to go through all of these things and just"
4145040,4154000," give them new line can your beam do that can you beam do that can you beam do that okay so we also have"
4154000,4164240," to do that stuff and a boom look at that look at it so theoretically when i run this entire thing"
4165040,4171360," it should oh you can't just run it of course i forgot it should just run ffm"
4171360,4184480," so we just run ffm back as a separate path it doesn't do anything right but there we go so"
4188400,4196080," yeah a lot of um pain and tears went to in went into researching how to start a separate process on"
4196080,4202720," windows but it paid off it actually paid off and this is the reason why i don't remove any of these"
4202720,4206560," comments because i believe these comments are important right because they they contain the"
4206560,4211120," sources where i copy pasted different things and stuff like that so just like i do not remove any of"
4211120,4219040," that in case i will need that in the future very very important uh so uh yes so yes we can try to"
4219040,4224480," maybe convert something but to convert something we need to generate some sort of video so let's"
4224480,4229600," literally generate a video using main role do we already have main role yeah there we go so"
4229600,4237280," let's generate the video um with a regular ff impact uh and if we take a look at the video uh it"
4237280,4240800," should be just like a bouncing ball nothing special so this is something that we've seen on the"
4240800,4250480," previous stream right um okay so in that example in that specific example um we can provide output mp4"
4250480,4255920," like you have to do a minus i and let's try to convert it to a different maybe container let's"
4255920,4262800," convert it to mtv right and see how it's going to go so let's recompile the windows application right"
4262800,4265760," everything seems to be compiled and uh let's run it"
4269040,4269360," okay"
4269360,4279120," it's pretty cool we are running ffmpeg yeah look at that build by mcs2"
4279120,4285360," we're not running linux ffmpeg we're literally running windows ffmpeg from a windows application"
4285360,4288400," that we compiled with min.gw and we're running with wine"
4288400,4295280," that's a lot of layers of abstraction to unpack to be fair and the fact that it works is freaking surprising"
4296000,4308080," um so so wait a second can we take a look at the okay here's mkv and yeah mkv works right"
4308080,4313040," windows development on linux windows development on linux"
4315520,4322160," very interesting very interesting very interesting very very interesting"
4322160,4328480," so wine was improved a lot in the last decade yeah you can even feel that you can even feel that and"
4328480,4336640," i don't really have the latest wine to be honest um but even the old wine that comes with my old ass"
4336640,4344000," operating system is still pretty good it's pretty good uh so at some point i'm telling you it's gonna"
4344000,4349360," get so good the microsoft will finally realize oh we we can't really develop this kind of"
4349360,4356880," shit anymore let's let those guys to continue maintaining and develop it um all right"
4356880,4366240," so it's interesting can i just like use the windows version of fmpeg as a daily"
4366240,4371520," driver instead of my linux ffmpeg in case my linux ffmpeg doesn't support something"
4373520,4382000," that sounds like an interesting idea actually uh but anyway so maybe there's some codec that my"
4382000,4387520," version does not support and it doesn't work that slow to be fair right because it's not emulated"
4387520,4392320," right so because wine doesn't emulate anything it literally re-implements the uh the abstraction layer"
4396640,4403040," so um okay so i already copy pasted this sort of like abstraction with ffmpeg and stuff like that"
4403040,4413440," i copy pasted it from usualizer uh what i'm thinking is that we need to create an opaque type for the for"
4413440,4422400," the pid and stuff like that because in case of the in case of the windows i suppose um it's just not gonna"
4422400,4430480," work that well it's just not gonna work that well because you have handle and handle can you yeah it's"
4430480,4437120," kind of difficult so it would be better to maybe have something like type def void ffmpeg and essentially"
4437120,4444960," instead of returning integer you return a pointer to ffmpeg but since it's void like the the user of this"
4444960,4451200," library doesn't know what it's referring to it's opaque right so this is how you create a opaque type"
4451200,4456960," encapsulation right encapsulation this is how encapsulation work and every time you need to"
4456960,4464160," send a frame to ffmpeg you're actually sending it through ffmpeg ffmpeg right and when you need to end"
4464160,4471600," rendering you end in it in here uh like so so essentially it's the in the actual representation"
4471600,4481120," is hide it from you handle is also just a void star says somebody in the chat true but we may want to"
4481120,4488880," keep track not only of the process handle we may keep track also of the pipe through which you're"
4488880,4496800," sending things you need to keep track two things so it would be better to just like have an opaque thing"
4496800,4504000," in my opinion i think it would be better to have an opaque thing uh and even for for linux it would be"
4504000,4511840," nice to to track pid right now in linux we do not track pit uh so and essentially what we do when we"
4511840,4519840," want to end the rendering we just do wait new which waits for a change of the status of any of the children"
4519840,4526160," which works fine for this example because you only have one child but if you're going to use that in a"
4526160,4532880," bigger application you may have several children right it would be nice to at least provide a pointer to like"
4532880,4538480," who you're waiting for specifically i don't remember which wait there is one of the weights there are"
4538480,4543920," several versions of this function that accepts the pits like the child which you monitor so it would"
4543920,4550080," be nice to have that here as well so that means like the structure that keeps track of a five impact"
4550080,4555920," state may become more complicated in the future so i think it makes sense to introduce that opaque type"
4555920,4560320," just for like a future proof situation you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking"
4560320,4565680," about i think you know what i'm talking about mine point so let's go and do that let's go and do that"
4565680,4574400," enough talk let's freaking implement this shit oh so i wonder how what would be the best way to do that"
4574400,4580160," we don't really have to even include the ffm back here so that's fine uh since i'm not including the actual"
4580160,4587120," header in here right so i can create an internal ffm back like this so and in here we're going to have"
4587120,4593520," pid and pipe right so pid and pipe so and in here we're going to be returning ffm back"
4593520,4601040," here we're going to be accepting ffm back which is points here we're also accepting ffm back"
4603200,4611280," and here we also going to be accepting ffm back boom so let's go and try to compile this entire thing"
4611280,4617920," uh right we need to do windows linux compilation right so you have to be careful i have windows and"
4617920,4624240," linux separate two separate things so i'm compiling linux right now uh all right so there we go this is"
4624240,4632000," what i'm talking about so this is the user code uh we do it like that look how nice it looks like it"
4632000,4638560," almost feels like f open you know what i'm talking about f open right it also has this opaque file"
4638560,4643920," type uh right and you return a pointer you're not supposed to look into it i'm not sure if it's also"
4643920,4649440," defined as void maybe not but it acts like a void type right so it's a big you're not supposed to look"
4649440,4655760," into it it's an abstract thing op encapsulation abstraction inheritance all these good things that"
4655760,4662320," everyone masturbates to yes yes we are using them uh so our code is clean our code is clean trust me"
4662320,4668560," kappa so here we have minus oh because of that we have to return null in here in case of an error okay"
4668560,4676320," so that makes sense so now we return the pointer so it's a completely different conventione um interestingly"
4676320,4685040," so here we are creating a pipe inside of the well no no we're creating it inside of the parent because"
4685040,4696720," child is zero no it is a child so i feel like this one should do exit one yeah if child is equal to zero"
4696720,4703280," that means we are in the child process we are in the child process so and if we couldn't attach"
4703280,4708800," the pipe to the standard input i think it's not enough to do just return because it's going to return"
4708800,4713680," out of the function it's going to like behave kind of weirdly we have to crash the whole process with"
4713680,4721440," exit one i think that makes sense yeah so in kind of similarly yeah we have to crash here as well"
4723040,4729760," right and this one is unreachable so that's fine uh all right so let's take a look at that so exit one"
4729760,4735840," uh is that because i don't have std lib apparently i don't have a std lib look at that"
4735840,4743520," uh i don't have a std lib what else pipefd right so from this function i do not return pipefd anymore i"
4743520,4748000," returned this structure but pointed to this structure so that means we need to allocate it"
4748000,4752720," preferably on a heap right it's going to be easier to handle it this way so let's do"
4752720,4760080," malloc size of ffm pack uh right and then we do ffm pack pointed to ffm pack and in here we're going"
4760080,4767760," to have pid uh which is child right so this is the child ffm pack pipe uh is going to be this pipe in"
4767760,4776000," here and then we just return ffm pack just return it back and of course malloc can fail malloc can fail"
4776000,4782560," but it will only fail in one case only one case if you're poor and don't have any money to buy"
4782560,4788800," more ram that's that's the only reason why it would fail right if it's equal it's not equal to null and"
4788800,4800720," in that case buy more more ram load have a go so malloc is the best indication if you're poor right"
4800720,4808000," if it returns new that means you're poor you don't have enough ram just buy more ram just stop being poor"
4808000,4811920," it's that fucking simple that's the best way to handle this kind of situation"
4811920,4825680," all right so let's go uh to the rest of compilation errors so this is the end uh here we are closing the"
4825680,4834960," pipe and then we're waiting on anything but i think wait doesn't accept uh wait doesn't accept the yeah it"
4834960,4842000," doesn't accept the it waits for the change of the status of any uh of the of the children so i suppose"
4842000,4850320," maybe we can do wait pid but what kind of options do you have to provide uh so means wait for any child"
4850320,4857680," process whose process group id is equal to that of the calling process uh is that really oh it's a pid but"
4857680,4868400," where is the options uh uh the value of options is or zero or more is an or of zero or more of the"
4868400,4876400," following uh constants uh return immediately if no children has existed and traced can i just like put zero"
4876400,4882960," in here i feel like i can just put zero in here like i don't want to with options to be fair right now i'm too"
4882960,4890960," tired i'm too hippy today for that so i can do uh ffmpeg pid uh i don't care about that i don't care about"
4890960,4903120," that uh and a boom boom there we go so that's pretty cool that's pretty cool and we have two uh ffmpegs for"
4903120,4908640," sending frames um you know the regular one that just sends the frame and the one that is flipped it is needed"
4908640,4915120," for situations like with ray leap uh right because in ray leap when we get the pixels out of the render"
4915120,4921200," texture it is flipped so we have to flip it while sending luckily somebody on in the youtube comments"
4921200,4928720," uh in the previous session actually said that in ffmpeg there is a flag uh i wonder if i can find it"
4928720,4937200," which is v flip i can't find it right so just a second uh i hope it was not gpt model that confabulated"
4937200,4943600," this kind of flag because it might have been uh limited out uh right"
4943600,4955760," flip i'm pretty sure it was the gpt model that confabulated that flag specifically uh ffmpeg flip vertically"
4955760,4963840," uh v flip maybe maybe how can i rotate video well i mean not rotate do you know the difference between"
4963840,4969360," flipping and flipping and rotating jesus the age of ai everyone um"
4969360,4976320," so there's a h flip and v okay so there is such thing"
4976320,4988160," uh all right okay so there is a v flip so we can use something like that instead of flipping ourselves and"
4988160,4991920," maybe this is something that we're going to employ in the future but i could not be bothered to do it right"
4991920,4996720," oh right so this is just something that i wanted to mention that it's it's better to probably do that"
4996720,5001120," on the level of fmpeg just send whatever you have to ffmpeg and let it process all of that"
5001120,5010640," um okay so here we do ffmpeg pipe so we send that to a pipe and this here is a ffmpeg pipe so by the way"
5010640,5015200," all these operations can also fail and we probably want to handle that as well"
5015200,5023760," uh so which is probably worth creating some sort of a to do which worth creating some sort of to do"
5023760,5034720," so first to do i would like to create is the one for um the ffmpeg to do use v flip of ffmpeg instead"
5036080,5045360," also handle potential error that may happen in all of the ffmpeg"
5045360,5053200," functions right because right now they return void kind of insinuating that they may not fail"
5053200,5060000," but they may fail right and they probably will fail especially if you just run ffmpeg and like forcefully"
5060000,5066320," kill the child ffmpeg process we literally cannot handle that situation but it may happen for whatever"
5066320,5071680," reason so i think the the main application should be able to handle that somehow right please stop"
5071680,5075680," sending frames and just like say the child process has died f"
5075680,5088640," so okay uh let's go to to here and does it compile i think i think everything should compile now okay that's"
5088640,5099280," pretty cool so now uh let's go ahead and uh try to compile the windows part right and yeah i need to"
5099280,5112080," start developing all of that thing so ffmpeg windows.c all right and for windows.c uh we're going to"
5113600,5122320," just implement all of these things in here but the implementation of the ffmpeg structure"
5122320,5129120," is going to be completely different uh it is going to have h process"
5129120,5140560," and probably pipe like this so and according to the notation we have to do h pipe right so we have h process"
5140560,5148160," and the h pipe uh so that's how we're going to be doing all of that okay so here we're going to be"
5148160,5151680," returning null for now i'm going to handle that"
5151680,5161520," okay so here we should start the process so let's go to windows"
5164160,5171200," and starting the process is as simple as this right we all know that we all actually know that"
5171200,5176000," so this is going to be the pit uh and i'm going to copy it up until the pit"
5176000,5182080," uh so in here i suppose what i'll have to do is just do ffmpeg"
5183520,5194960," um malloc by the way on windows you're not supposed to use malloc right so win api has its own like memory"
5194960,5202960," allocation things um but i don't know them so i'm going to fix that later right uh use windows"
5204480,5213120," specific allocation stuff right so i heard i heard that it's generally bad idea to depend on lipc"
5213120,5220480," in your windows applications and essentially win api has everything that lipc provides and lipc"
5220480,5225120," implementation for windows is just like a very shitty and stuff like that so you kind of want to avoid that"
5225120,5232080," uh portability layer issues yeah i don't know but since it's convenient right now i'm gonna just like"
5232080,5237840," stick to it all right and we can maybe fix that later when i feel like it when somebody actually"
5237840,5246960," complains right uh okay so this is assert and essentially what i'm gonna do is ffmpeg h process"
5246960,5253280," right so just copy this h process in here but i don't have a pipe right i don't have a pipe"
5255920,5264240," and as far as i know we are creating pipe in no build as well so there was something for creating"
5264240,5270480," yeah so for example there's a cross platform function make pipe and on windows it does this"
5270480,5279200," right so there's literally a function create pipe and yeah that's basically it's actually very straightforward"
5279200,5292000," look at it it's as simple as that okay so maybe that's what we can do essentially essentially essentially"
5292000,5297360," so ffmpeg windows but we have to create that pipe before we create the process"
5297360,5306080," right because we're going to be sending that pipe as the standard input as the standard input so and i"
5306080,5312880," also want to preserve that pipe uh so that means i need to create this particular structure that we're"
5312880,5319840," going to be returning first right so i'm creating this uh structure first and then i'm creating a pipe"
5319840,5327120," uh but i'm creating the read pipe what do we need do we need the right pipe or read pipe i don't quite"
5327120,5335120," remember so like we need both of them right i feel like we need both because one we're going to be using"
5335120,5343440," for the child process and another one we're going to be yeah this one yeah this one is very interesting"
5343440,5358400," so let me see let me see let me see the wording of uh creating the pipe so file handling"
5358400,5361760," okay"
5366560,5383680," they really don't want you to use the reason what you do uh so pointed to a variable that receives the"
5383680,5391200," read handle of the pipe so that means you're supposed to read from that handle which means that this is"
5391200,5398000," something that we're going to pass to the child pass to the child so okay let's create two things here"
5398000,5413760," handle um pipe read and pipe write uh peep right pipe read and pipe right so and i suppose pipe read is going"
5413760,5421520," to go to here pipe read so this is the input and pipe right is going to go into this structure and since"
5421520,5427520," yeah since i don't have to do it like that i may actually give it a little bit later so let's actually"
5427520,5432480," do it here so in the pipe this is going to be pipe right there we go"
5432480,5440320," yep i think that's it i think that is actually it uh so that's that's how we're going to be doing all"
5440320,5445440," that's that's how we're going to do all that so sending a frame sending a flip frame i don't really"
5445440,5455520," know how to do that yet but can you write into handle or right so windows uh win api write to handle"
5455520,5463520," how do you write to handle uh write file i suppose that's just write file uh do you have to flash it or"
5463520,5478320," anything like that um so yeah i guess it's a write write file uh let's i'm gonna just like copy paste it"
5478320,5487760," in here but i'm not gonna use it yet because i want to implement end rendering and when we're ending the"
5487760,5494000," rendering we're just waiting for the kids and stuff like that yeah so we're waiting for the for the"
5494000,5504240," object uh and close the handle and let me just paste it in here uh okay okay okay okay okay so now"
5504240,5511680," here's an interesting point we don't really need a separate source code for windows example"
5513600,5520320," we don't really need a separate source code we can just use main row all right we can just use main row"
5520320,5525680," and use the ffmpeg stuff because basically windows stuff is abstracted away"
5525680,5534560," right so the same code this same code should now work on windows we just have to link it with a different"
5534560,5547600," thing you know so um let me get rid of the main windows right and this executable so then i'm going"
5547600,5556720," to do mingw and this one is going to be main row win uh we are going to be supplying main row.c main"
5556720,5563680," row.c but on top of that instead of supplying ffmpeg linux we're supplying ffmpeg windows and that"
5563680,5569680," should automatically works at least that's the goal at least that's the goal so let's go ahead"
5569680,5575440," and do that so of course it's going to fail and everything uh and okay so we have some linux specific"
5575440,5579920," stuff left so this is something that we have to remove right so it should not be here uh that's for"
5579920,5584960," sure what else do we have in here okay so we are in the windows specific stuff so that means we have"
5584960,5594560," to include windows attach and define win 32 lin and min uh okay so the rest of the compilation errors so"
5594560,5601920," some typing errors nothing special panic okay that's fine so here what we're gonna do"
5603040,5611600," i'm gonna just do fprintf std error so this is error get last error okay so i think i removed this thing"
5611600,5620800," uh let me grab this kind of stuff from no built uh where it is located so i should bring it back"
5621600,5628960," maybe even make it static so it basically just optimizes the stuff or whatever uh and let's compile"
5628960,5639040," it one more time a printf so let's include stdio okay so uh get last okay so this one probably has to"
5639040,5644000," be visible in all of the places where we use it so i'm going to define it on top and here it's not going"
5644000,5652480," to be visible outside of the translation unit uh right so okay so assert let's include assert"
5652480,5660400," let's include assert and what else do we have so yeah in case of an error we return one in this code"
5660400,5667120," but now since we're returning the um you know pointers we don't have to do that what else do we have"
5667120,5673360," so pipe it's called hpipe i renamed it to hpipe to follow the convention and stuff like that"
5673360,5683200," so here ffmpec uh h process uh h process and what else do we have so this is no so it's kind of all over"
5683200,5692640," the place uh i don't really like that uh ffmpec h process so this is exit status uh huh so what i'm"
5692640,5697440," doing here i'm just like following the compilation errors okay so ending yeah this one is interesting so"
5697440,5702640," ending the rendering can also fail but we don't have a way to uh report that stuff"
5703520,5708880," right so maybe but since i have to do so it doesn't really matter i'll get to properly reporting errors"
5708880,5719520," out of this function later uh huh okay so in this one is ffmpec uh h process boom"
5719520,5732080," okay so we have a windows implementation of this small ffmpec library uh right and i didn't even do anything super"
5732080,5738800," complicated i was just following compilation errors right so i just copy pasted a bunch of chunks of"
5738800,5744560," code that i researched a long time ago and i literally duct taped them together until there's"
5744560,5750960," no more compilation errors and good to go ship it that's how software development is done in 2023 everyone"
5750960,5758480," what unit tests continues what what the ff are you talking continuous integration what the ff is"
5758480,5765040," unit test continues you just like duct tape it until the compiles and you just ship that's it is as"
5765040,5773040," simple as that man for me it's that simple as that because if it compiles say the line chat say the"
5773040,5782160," line if it compiles it works that's right that's what being aesthetically typed language means right none of"
5782160,5788720," that javascript boosh is uh anyway uh so"
5788720,5797280," we got the executable so we have a main row i have a feeling that it's not gonna work first try but we"
5797280,5804960," we're gonna try it anyway uh so i'm gonna just go ahead and do wine main row first of all let's remove all"
5804960,5813280," the videos just to confirm that it actually produces the video and let's do one main row uh win exe"
5813280,5822400," okay that's very interesting uh opening input"
5825200,5833680," opening input file output mp4 oh i know what is going on yeah of course so it kind of worked by the"
5833680,5841120," way believe it or not it kind of worked but um i didn't provide the correct command line arguments in"
5841120,5849760," here right so it's just like yeah so you have to provide um this kind of command line arguments right"
5850480,5856960," so and it's a little bit of pain in the ass because on linux these command line arguments are separate"
5856960,5862960," arguments that you pass to a function on freaking windows it's a single string literal"
5862960,5872320," and of course it probably has some sort of like a syntax maybe there is a way to pass it as an array"
5872320,5877680," because there's a lot of arguments in here so let me actually check it out uh right let me let me check it"
5877680,5894080," out uh process a so command line it's a single string no there is no arguments you literally have to uh pass"
5894080,5901200," like a string in here and that means that it has some sort of a syntax and what's the syntax does it have"
5901200,5909680," does it process double quotes or something like that so right but what if the filename that you supply"
5909680,5914880," contains double quotes"
5914880,5923360," anyway so maybe there is a way to do that more robustly um"
5925360,5934640," edge case is polvo yeah exactly exactly exactly exactly is there like a class of attacks of"
5934640,5938960," injecting command line arguments through the create process or something like that i'm pretty"
5938960,5940640," sure there should be some sort of class of attacks"
5940640,5951920," this string is directly passed to the process you're calling and it's up to the receiving process to part i"
5951920,5960400," do not do not believe it i refuse to believe the shits wait a second what's the signature of win main"
5960400,5968160," please don't tell me that"
5972240,5977920," so you you you were not joking right so you you you were not joking"
5977920,5991520," wstr so wstr is something else what is wstr though"
5993280,6001200," why microsoft is brewing this hard um"
6001200,6012240," it's a so it's it's several uh it's a white string but i mean it's a single string nonetheless"
6012240,6015200," so and that's what's important it's a single string nonetheless"
6018400,6029520," anyways um so how can we quickly do all of that how can we click quickly do all of that we can try to"
6029520,6036640," copy paste all of these arguments then we can try to get rid of the maybe commas"
6039680,6047360," and since this is c we can just merge them like that and for the most part this is going to be"
6047360,6056160," considered a single string literal right except for the resolution and frame rate right except for the"
6056160,6062400," resolution and frame rate but for the resolution and the frame rate we can just put them as s right"
6062400,6070160," we can just put them as s and we can try to do some sort of like a sn printf um so we can have some sort"
6070160,6076640," of like a cmd buffer which is going to be in one kilobyte one kilobyte is going to be enough for"
6076640,6085840," everybody right so something like this uh let's make it two kilo kilobytes sure why not i'm feeling spicy today"
6088560,6099680," uh all right and what uh it doesn't even have to be s it could be zoo uh so this is the resolution"
6099680,6111520," so that means it has to be w so it's zooks oh yeah this is the famous cogsucker machine uh all right so"
6111520,6120320," and uh where's the other s so the frame rate has to be just this and we can just pass width height and"
6120320,6133200," fps there right so it's going to be width height and fps uh fps so that's it and we can pass cmd buffer in"
6133200,6140960," here because think two kilobytes is going to be enough for this thing man so two kilobytes on the stack is"
6140960,6147040," a good idea right in 2023 it's it's a good idea but i mean we're doing that for windows so we don't"
6147040,6157440," care uh anyways so let me try to ah this is another one it's uh did it did it abort i can't abort this"
6157440,6169680," it doesn't stop uh if i kill"
6169680,6177360," but maybe that's what you're supposed to have in here"
6177360,6182000," i think it's"
6186880,6202240," excuse me what the is going on this is hanging so people say wine server minus k to kill everything"
6202240,6206960," oh okay okay thank you so much i didn't know what the has happened but i mean"
6206960,6212400," that is scary i'm not gonna lie what i want you to do i just want you to compile this"
6212400,6220960," okay so it seems to be compound and i'm i'm super happy super happy uh all right so let me try to run"
6220960,6230480," this thing now could not okay uh the program main row has encountered a serious problem and needs to"
6230480,6235840," close we're sorry for the inconvenience this can be caused by a problem in the okay so what does it mean"
6235840,6242400," does it mean that uh it's a sec fold right so it's sec faulted uh so the buffer was not enough"
6242400,6247440," uh right so the buffer was not enough to to do that"
6247440,6251200," windows"
6251200,6258880," uh so the buffer was not enough to do that because the buffer was not enough to do that"
6258880,6260800," so it was not enough to do that so it didn't even print anything"
6260800,6265440," yeah could not create child process file not found oh this one is interesting"
6266000,6271360," uh because none of that shed is separated by spaces of course"
6271360,6277440," okay we can do a simple trick just to replace this thing with a single space"
6277440,6281040," easy peasy lemon squeezy"
6281040,6289200," okay so let's review that one more time uh and uh so just try to do that boom boom"
6290960,6295200," okay that's pretty cool uh error opening input file dash"
6295200,6299200," so"
6299200,6307840," so maybe you have to do that slightly differently maybe you have to indicate"
6307840,6315920," um directly pipe or something i remember um ff unpack read"
6317360,6321520," input from pipe there was a special syntax for pipes and sheets"
6321520,6328160," uh pipe input to ff impact yeah pipe zero or something like that yeah um"
6328160,6330080," so"
6330080,6336400," input pipe so but they omit the handler"
6336400,6344880," okay so let's literally try pipe then so this is going to be"
6347120,6348160," uh pipe"
6348160,6354800," okay again and boom okay"
6354800,6363840," uh error reading file pipe"
6363840,6370640," uh pipe zero okay let's give a try pipe zero"
6370640,6376880," i wonder if it like windows ffmpeg doesn't support this kind of stuff"
6377840,6380880," i wonder if windows ffmpeg doesn't support this kind of stuff"
6380880,6384160," but we're getting closer hopefully"
6384160,6392480," yeah it cannot invalid arguments so it cannot open any of that stuff that's actually kind of soggy"
6397200,6398240," okay so um"
6398240,6405200," oh wait that's a good point so does it say"
6405200,6415120," so are you telling thank you thank you so much yeah so it was somebody said that in the chat uh thank you"
6417280,6418240," so that means"
6418240,6418240," so that means"
6418240,6419840," so that means but there"
6419840,6425040," all right so z u essentially"
6425040,6430640," the thing for size t right it's a special thing for size t"
6430640,6436880," we can replace it with d of course but the problem is that d is signed and size t is unsigned"
6436880,6441360," so yeah yeah let's just do that that's not that big of a deal"
6441360,6442560," um"
6442560,6446240," yeah this is ah"
6446240,6455840," wine server okay okay so essentially if you run this thing and ctrl c it's gonna"
6455840,6462560," stuck and you'll have to do wine server minus k for whatever reason uh you can't just you can just"
6462560,6469040," stop it dude it feels literally like windows because on windows if you started some process of"
6469040,6471520," processing something you can't easily stop that"
6471520,6475040," wine is just like windows holy"
6475040,6479680," we can inherited that windows you know what i'm talking about"
6479680,6484560," you can't just stop anything right so you can't just press cancel it's not gonna work"
6484560,6490320," um it's basically windows um anyway so let's just give it a try"
6494880,6503200," yo what the fuck is it gonna do shit wait it is doing the scheisse i don't see output in here but"
6503200,6515200," it's kind of stuck yeah wine server minus k so it kind of yeah all right all right so"
6515200,6520880," that's already progress right it's stalling but so pipe"
6523440,6528160," let's put dash back let's put the dash back um"
6528160,6531760," so let's recompile"
6531760,6539840," oh"
6539840,6544240," i mean"
6544240,6549440," what did they expect"
6553440,6562880," uh"
6562880,6572320," i'm gonna implement it later of course um"
6572320,6582400," let's do ffmpec uh h pipe so the buffer we can just provide the data so the number of bytes to write"
6583200,6586320," size of u in 32 t"
6586320,6594000," width height so it's gonna tell me how many how many things it's written uh but do i care"
6594000,6601360," can i just say no uh and lp overlap i don't know what the fuck is it like why does it always have some"
6601360,6606000," weird additional parameters that usually i don't give a fuck about like"
6606640,6607360," overlapped"
6607360,6607760," overlapped"
6607760,6616240," overlapped excuse me like what is what is to overlap in here freaking windows i swear to get"
6616240,6617440," overlapped"
6617440,6619520," um"
6619520,6622480," so let's read what the fuck is that"
6622480,6625440," the pointer to an overlapped the pointer to an overlapped structure"
6625440,6633120," is required if a file parameter was opened with flag overlapped otherwise this parameter can be null"
6633120,6635280," for"
6635280,6637760," i"
6637760,6638800," i really like how"
6638800,6641760," like win api"
6641760,6642320," arguments"
6642320,6644160," they initially usually"
6644160,6645840," make sense"
6645840,6646800," and at some point"
6646800,6649440," they stop making sense it's just like"
6649440,6654240," it's almost like random arguments they do random things in like unrelated play like what"
6656080,6661680," i suppose i didn't have to provide so it can be null so i don't even have to care what it is right so i can just say"
6661680,6664560," i don't care"
6664560,6675200," so and here it's flipped so it's also implemented right so i'm gonna grab the flipped from linux implementation"
6675200,6678960," i'm gonna grab the flipped from linux"
6680880,6683520," and in here it's gonna be just write file"
6683520,6685040," h pipe"
6685040,6688160," so ff impact data though"
6688160,6688800," yeah so"
6688800,6690960," yeah it's it's not"
6690960,6692000," yeah so it's like this"
6692000,6694560," width size of"
6694560,6695040," and then"
6695040,6696720," null"
6696720,6699840," what was the"
6699840,6702320," what was the other one before"
6702320,6705360," uh number of bytes in here okay"
6705360,6706480," so that should be it"
6706480,6709440," uh that should be it hopefully"
6710240,6711520," okay so it doesn't compile"
6711520,6713520," that's fine"
6713520,6715200," let's do int"
6715200,6717440," okay"
6717440,6720320," the moment of truth"
6720320,6726480," i'm gonna"
6726480,6727120," fucking cry"
6727120,6732400," huh"
6732400,6735760," and it's stuck"
6735760,6740080," at least it is creating"
6740480,6740800," okay"
6740800,6740800," okay"
6740800,6743520," it can't really finish it"
6743520,6746240," can i just"
6746240,6746560," okay"
6746560,6747280," control c"
6747280,6748080," that's fine"
6748080,6749280," if we take a look at this thing"
6749280,6751200," and it doesn't play"
6751200,6753280," so it didn't finalize it unfortunately"
6753280,6755120," hmm"
6755120,6757520," so"
6757520,6759600," how do we stop"
6759600,6760560," when we stop"
6760560,6763840," yeah that makes sense"
6763840,6764640," we just wait"
6764640,6766400," we just wait until it finishes"
6766400,6770400," you know what we have to do"
6770400,6771040," we have to"
6771040,6772320," close"
6772320,6776560," we need to close the pipe first"
6776560,6777200," to sort of"
6777200,6779840," the way it stops on linux by the way"
6779840,6781920," the the way it stops on linux"
6781920,6783760," we first close the pipe"
6783760,6786960," which triggers ffm pack to finish"
6786960,6788000," because the input"
6788000,6788960," the standard input"
6788960,6789840," has been closed"
6789840,6792640," i wonder if we can just say"
6792640,6793840," close"
6793840,6795920," handle"
6795920,6797280," ffm pack"
6797280,6798640," h pipe"
6799520,6801360," and then wait until ffm pack"
6801360,6802400," finalizes everything"
6802400,6803760," all right"
6803760,6804720," so it's some sort of like"
6804720,6806080," practical protocol"
6806080,6807200," we are in"
6807200,6808160," telling ffm pack"
6808160,6809200," that we're done rendering"
6809200,6810640," by closing the standard input"
6810640,6811600," and this is how it knows"
6811600,6812560," and this is where it starts"
6812560,6813600," to finalize everything"
6813600,6815840," all right"
6815840,6816080," so"
6816080,6819040," okay let's give it a try"
6819040,6820080," so it should render"
6820080,6821120," 10 second video"
6821120,6823120," hopefully closing the pipe"
6823120,6823920," should indicate"
6827360,6828720," that's not enough"
6828720,6829520," that's not enough"
6829520,6838560," maybe you close the pipe differently"
6838560,6840800," maybe you do it differently"
6840800,6841920," so"
6841920,6844880," winipi"
6844880,6848160," close child std in"
6848160,6849840," all right"
6849840,6852640," maybe even something like pipe"
6855360,6856400," creating child process"
6856400,6857760," we directed input output"
6857760,6858160," yeah"
6858160,6858720," so that's"
6858720,6861760," a really well known thing"
6861760,6864080," create child process"
6864080,6864320," yeah"
6864320,6865840," so create file pipe"
6865840,6866800," and stuff like that"
6866800,6869680," so we're creating a file"
6869680,6872800," and we write to pipe"
6872800,6874080," okay"
6874080,6876080," then we create the child process"
6876080,6877280," so create the process"
6877280,6881920," close the handle"
6885360,6886000," right"
6886000,6886080," right"
6886080,6886080," right"
6886080,6886640," to pipe"
6886640,6888640," did you close the child"
6888640,6889680," okay"
6889680,6890960," did you close the child handle"
6890960,6892160," when creating the process"
6892160,6893040," it can be used"
6893040,6893760," after that"
6893760,6894400," wait for"
6894400,6896080," single object"
6896080,6898960," i closed"
6898960,6900160," h thread"
6900160,6902800," this is because what"
6902800,6903920," that's what tutorial"
6903920,6905200," was telling me to do"
6905200,6910320," and also"
6912960,6914560," maybe you should have closed the pipe"
6914560,6916560," yeah"
6916560,6917600," so i created"
6917600,6920640," pipe read"
6920640,6924000," should i close pipe read as well"
6924000,6929600," you need to use flush first"
6929600,6930800," so is it buffered"
6930800,6932880," win api flush"
6936960,6938560," flush file buffers"
6938560,6943520," i guess"
6943520,6944880," we can try to do that"
6944880,6945200," sure"
6945200,6948240," so this is ending"
6948240,6948480," okay"
6948480,6949440," flush"
6949440,6952480," file buffers"
6952480,6953200," so it is"
6953200,6955120," buffered"
6955120,6960400," so then we close the handle"
6962000,6963440," hopefully that triggers"
6963440,6966720," maybe we have to close both"
6966720,6968400," like a read and"
6968400,6969600," oh yeah"
6969600,6969920," that's"
6969920,6970800," that's a good point"
6970800,6971200," actually"
6971200,6973120," all right"
6973120,6973360," so"
6973360,6975600," let's call this"
6975600,6976080," right"
6976080,6977440," and also keep"
6977440,6978400," track of read"
6978400,6980480," i think that's going to be beneficial"
6980480,6982320," so let's go through the compilation errors"
6982320,6982560," fuck"
6982560,6985440," wine server"
6985440,6985840," okay"
6985840,6988160," that's the wrong one"
6989120,6989680," all right"
6989680,6989920," so"
6989920,6991120," h"
6991120,6992880," write"
6992880,6996080," to the fan"
6996080,6997120," yeah"
6997120,6998720," h write is going to be that"
6998720,7000160," and h read"
7000160,7001920," is going to be that"
7001920,7010640," oh yeah"
7010640,7011920," i named them differently"
7011920,7013920," read"
7013920,7016480," write"
7019120,7019360," okay"
7019360,7022240," so this one"
7022240,7022800," is"
7022800,7023120," write"
7023120,7028320," maybe one of the things"
7028320,7028960," i have to do"
7028960,7030080," i have to close them"
7030080,7032720," i keep screwing it up"
7032720,7033680," i'm so sorry"
7033680,7035680," this is because again"
7035680,7036400," because i'm tired"
7036400,7037440," right"
7037440,7041040," what else"
7041040,7044240," here we have to flush the write"
7044240,7046080," and we're going to close the write"
7046080,7048240," but also maybe we're going to close the read"
7049120,7050640," uh"
7050640,7051040," write"
7051040,7053360," so but that's not enough"
7053360,7055200," that's not enough"
7055200,7059120," because when we create the pipe"
7059120,7060400," where do we create the pipe"
7060400,7061600," so here is the pipe"
7061600,7063280," read and write"
7063280,7065440," and then at the end in here"
7065440,7066640," we're just assigning them"
7066640,7067760," okay so that's"
7067760,7068480," that's fine"
7068480,7071360," and it seems to be compiling"
7071360,7072400," so let's give it a try"
7074560,7075280," uh-huh"
7075280,7076640," so it is processing"
7076640,7081760," that was not the case"
7081760,7085440," it was not the case"
7085440,7086480," it was not the case"
7086480,7089840," one of the things we can do"
7089840,7092080," okay so this is the last thing we can do"
7092080,7095760," we can set the length of the video"
7095760,7099120," maybe we can indicate the end of the video"
7099120,7100640," through setting the length of the video"
7100640,7102400," so ff impact will stop"
7102400,7106320," after we like generated everything"
7106320,7110320," so ff impact set length"
7110320,7113200," so this is the last thing i can think of"
7113200,7116320," video duration in here"
7118640,7119840," uh t duration"
7119840,7121600," okay so transcoded video sequence"
7121600,7123760," the duration specified in seconds"
7123760,7124400," okay that's cool"
7124400,7126960," so that means"
7126960,7128400," um"
7128400,7130720," yeah it kind of sucks"
7130720,7132320," that we literally can't"
7132320,7134160," do the same trick as we use on linux"
7134160,7135280," because in linux it's super easy"
7135280,7136480," you just close the pipe"
7136480,7138320," and that's an indication of the end"
7138320,7140240," but here"
7140240,7143200," we probably have to specify the length"
7143200,7145120," and where do we specify the length"
7145120,7146400," probably for the input"
7147200,7147680," right"
7147680,7149920," so essentially we have to do t"
7149920,7151440," and we have to specify the seconds"
7151440,7152400," if i'm not mistaken"
7152400,7152560," right"
7152560,7154160," so since"
7154160,7156800," the function does not accept the duration"
7156800,7157680," we're going to hard code it"
7157680,7160240," so let me take a look at the row"
7160240,7162240," and the row think"
7162240,7164000," and the duration is 10 seconds"
7164000,7165280," so we can put 10 in here"
7165280,7166000," right"
7166000,7170080," duration it is in seconds"
7170080,7173680," yeah so because you can accept the timestamp"
7173680,7174400," and everything"
7174400,7176320," so that should be fine"
7176320,7177760," and we have to be really precise"
7177760,7179760," in terms of the frames that we accept"
7179760,7180000," so"
7180000,7181360," um"
7181360,7181600," yeah"
7181600,7183680," let's give it a try"
7183680,7185200," so that's the last attempt"
7185200,7186480," that i'm going to make"
7186480,7188880," and that's the last hope"
7188880,7190720," to finally produce the video"
7190720,7196400," yeah"
7196400,7196880," i don't know"
7197760,7201360," so i'm gonna try to research that off screen"
7201360,7203440," right"
7203440,7204560," and see what's up with that"
7204560,7206480," and maybe i'm gonna put it in a footnote"
7206480,7207120," of the stream"
7207120,7209600," i'm gonna put it in the footnote of the stream"
7209600,7210240," because"
7210240,7212160," yeah it's just like a very tedious process"
7212160,7213360," of just trying different things"
7213360,7215120," and there's probably some sort of a hack"
7215120,7218080," there's probably some sort of a hack"
7218080,7219360," that you just have to like"
7219360,7221040," you know pull in there"
7221040,7222800," and it probably doesn't even make sense"
7222800,7224800," and it's probably based on some sort of like a weird"
7224800,7227520," you know compatibility shed or whatever"
7227520,7227760," right"
7227760,7229440," so it's not particularly important"
7229440,7230560," what's important is"
7230560,7233040," what's important is that"
7233040,7234800," we have a windows"
7234800,7237520," windows version of mutualizer"
7237520,7237840," right"
7237840,7238080," so"
7238080,7240960," we have build"
7240960,7242480," mutualizer"
7242480,7244000," like this"
7244000,7245760," we don't even have that"
7245760,7246960," but i mean just a second"
7246960,7248240," there we go"
7248240,7249200," right"
7249200,7250960," and this is a windows application"
7250960,7252320," so it is possible"
7252320,7253840," it is possible"
7253840,7255520," and it was rather straightforward"
7255520,7256400," right"
7256400,7258560," so the only thing that is left"
7258560,7260560," is to just like figure out how to"
7260560,7262720," send information to ffmpag"
7262720,7263840," but i mean we figured it out"
7263840,7266960," like we know we can send information to ffmpag"
7266960,7267600," it's just like"
7267600,7269600," we don't really know how to"
7269600,7272080," finish it"
7272080,7272320," right"
7272320,7274000," so how to tell ffmpag"
7274000,7274960," we're done"
7274960,7276480," we try to close this pipe"
7276480,7277600," but this is primarily because"
7277600,7279840," i don't know how pipe and windows work"
7279840,7280000," right"
7280000,7281760," i really don't know how they work"
7281760,7283840," so i'm going to research that a little bit"
7283840,7285920," and i'm going to just probably finish that offline"
7285920,7289200," and then maybe concatenate with the main vote"
7289200,7290480," and then upload it to youtube"
7290480,7290720," right"
7290720,7293280," so we have like an actually working thing with"
7293280,7294720," within a single session"
7294720,7295040," all right"
7295040,7296000," that's it for today"
7296000,7297200," i guess that was interesting"
7297200,7299760," thanks everyone who's watching right now"
7299760,7301120," i really appreciate that"
7301120,7301920," have a good one"
7301920,7303280," and i'll see you on the next"
7303280,7304960," recreational programming session"
7304960,7306080," with the azosin"
7306080,7306720," so yeah"
7306720,7307280," love you"
7307280,7309680," all right"
7309680,7311200," this is the footnote of the session"
7311200,7315280," and i was reading through the official microsoft article on how to create the child process"
7315280,7317040," and redirect input output"
7317040,7321600," and i found a very interesting piece of information that actually helps with our problem"
7321600,7323600," so essentially the end"
7323600,7327120," so essentially the end that you leave in a parent"
7327120,7330560," you have to mark it as non-inheritable"
7330560,7333440," because apparently if you don't do that"
7333440,7335760," it gets inherited by a child"
7335760,7338640," and because of that it never gets closed or something"
7338640,7341360," i do not fully understand what the hell is going on in here"
7341360,7345520," but doing that actually helps and solves the problem"
7345520,7347040," so let me demonstrate you"
7347040,7347920," right essentially"
7347920,7349760," so let's take this thing"
7349760,7353040," and the end that we keep into ourselves to the parent"
7353040,7355680," and where we're writing so the child can receive it"
7355680,7358000," we have to mark it as non-inheritable"
7358000,7359440," or something"
7359440,7361760," like is it like it's called inherit"
7361760,7364720," so we're setting it to zero so that means it's not inherited"
7364720,7365120," i guess"
7365120,7369360," right so don't inherit anything in here"
7369360,7372880," and of course it would be nice to maybe handle the error in here"
7372880,7374480," because it might happen"
7374480,7377440," so let's say could not set handle information"
7377440,7380320," let's capitalize everything properly"
7380320,7381920," and yeah that should be it"
7381920,7385600," so let me try to recompile this entire thing"
7385600,7389760," and now if i try to run the entire like rendering process"
7390720,7391840," it will render everything"
7391840,7395680," and finishes"
7395680,7397520," that's it"
7397520,7398640," that was it"
7398640,7400960," that was the entire problem"
7400960,7402400," and if we take a look at the video"
7402400,7404560," it's perfectly"
7404560,7405680," it works perfectly"
7405680,7408800," if you don't set that thing"
7408800,7410400," if you don't set that thing"
7410400,7411760," it is not going to work"
7411760,7412800," it's going to get stuck"
7412800,7416320," so i kind of vaguely understand"
7416320,7418320," what is going on in here"
7418320,7420560," but but not fully"
7420560,7424000," right because it's some sort of like a windows specific thing"
7424000,7426320," that i'm as a linux developer not really aware of"
7426320,7428800," but i just accept it as it is"
7428800,7430320," right so you see we're not setting"
7430320,7432480," this non-inheritance flag"
7432480,7434400," and it just hangs"
7434400,7438640," so my hypothesis is that since the that end is inherited by child"
7438640,7440160," child is supposed to close it"
7440160,7442560," but since the child doesn't close it"
7442560,7444000," it's not really fully closed"
7444000,7446000," and it's just like i don't know what is going on"
7446000,7449520," right so the only thing i know is that if you just do that"
7449520,7452640," it works perfectly and it does exactly"
7452640,7454320," what we want"
7454320,7459120," right it finishes as soon as we finish sending frames and closing that specific pipe"
7459680,7462960," and yeah it works which means"
7462960,7467840," that we can just try to go ahead and instantly integrate"
7467840,7472400," that windows implementation of ffmpac to mutualizer"
7472400,7477360," and have the video rendering in mutualizer already on today's session"
7477360,7480560," so that sounds interesting that sounds cool actually let's go ahead and do that"
7481200,7489040," so uh let's go i'm going to just go here and replace the ffmpac windows with our new one"
7489040,7495840," unfortunately the interface in mutualizer is slightly different than in that example"
7495840,7501440," because we also accept a sound file path so i need to take that into account as well"
7502560,7510240," all right so in the windows we uh have to accept we have to accept that output thingy"
7510240,7518160," uh right and i suppose suppose it's one of the inputs so the first input in here is standard input"
7518160,7524960," uh after that another input is this one and the question is where we have to do this so i suppose"
7524960,7534320," it's at the end uh source sound it's sound a sound file path so that's what's supposed to happen uh"
7534320,7540720," and let's just go to the compilation error so we already have buildsh that we can use um okay so"
7540720,7546640," buildsh just uses these flags so let me quickly remove them because because it calls to raylib my"
7546640,7553120," raylib environment is not properly set up so let's just like disable uh okay so let's go to the compilation"
7553120,7561360," and use variable size uh i wonder why is it complaining about that i mean yeah so apparently"
7561360,7566400," i never compiled this code with all the warnings turned on so that's why it has a lot of warnings"
7566400,7574800," interesting so here it's integer but we know you cannot see scheisse by the way right so it's complaining"
7574800,7582800," that we're using uh d on unsigned thingy but if i don't do that it's we can replace it with you"
7583120,7590080," oh let's keep it d uh let's keep it d okay so everything seems to be fine the only thing we're"
7590080,7595600," missing in here is the ff unpack executable so let me quickly bring the ff unpack executable here"
7595600,7605680," uh all right so ff impact xc all right and the question is in the build sh where we're building it we're"
7605680,7611920," building it into the build okay so let me recompile everything one more time just in case everything"
7611920,7620400," seems to be compiling i'm super happy let's do build and usualizer uh exe wine all right all right all right"
7620400,7633280," all right so let's go to pc mvm pc management uh programming uh sorting mutualizer music i'm actually"
7633280,7640640," navigating the the things blindly completely so and let's take this shirt uh thing and render it"
7640640,7650000," okay is it actually sending shit to ff unpack i feel like maybe it does it's it's really hard to tell"
7650000,7657680," if it's actually sending shit there okay so it started ff unpack at least uh we can take a look at the"
7657680,7669200," uh maybe output okay so there is output but i can't see if it actually like creates anything you know the"
7669200,7679600," logging of ray leap is kind of yeah i wonder if i can disable login i should be able to disable login right so"
7679600,7689680," um i remember in ray leap there was a way set trace log a level right so you could do something like that"
7689680,7699040," and visualizer src visualizes somewhere at the beginning we're going to say okay set log trace level"
7699040,7709200," and there was like a level none log level yeah log none disable login completely um right it would be still nice to see the"
7709200,7714400," initialization of like window devices and stuff like that so maybe i'm going to set it like after we"
7714400,7723360," initialized everything so yeah let's go ahead and do that so let's do the build and let's start"
7723360,7733440," the visualizer yeah that thing that locks every time we get pixels from the texture is a bit annoying not gonna lie"
7734720,7745440," all right are we sending okay input file all right all right oh i see what is going on"
7745440,7753040," that's literally the thing that i was talking about you need to follow some sort of a syntax because the"
7753040,7760720," file name contains spaces you need to literally wrap it in uh quotes like this is literally why on posix"
7760720,7765680," arguments are separated so you don't have to think about this kind of stuff windows people like what"
7765680,7774960," anyways uh whatever uh we can fix that sure not a big deal not a big deal"
7776000,7784880," so um where's the s so you just need to put you know quotes in here um so let's try to compile it one"
7784880,7798000," more time and uh run it one more time of course uh and let's go a boom boom we are rendering we are"
7798000,7805680," rendering very freaking slowly very freaking slow look at that speed of rendering holy why is it so slow"
7805680,7813120," uh is that because it's like a full hd like on linux it is definitely way faster on linux it is"
7813120,7821200," definitely way faster um so i'm just thinking maybe i can try to reduce the resolution or maybe the bit"
7821200,7826880," rate or something like that or i can just like literally wait until the end and just cut to that"
7826880,7834880," i don't know i don't really want to cut anything so let's try to reduce the um you know the it's it's"
7834880,7843280," not even that big honestly it's not even that big okay so let's do whatever quality will be decided by"
7844320,7850960," um by ffmpack and let's reduce the resolution of this entire thing so i think um the resolution is"
7850960,7855520," in here so let's make it 60 and the render fps is going to be 30 so we're going to render that in a"
7855520,7860560," crappier um in a crappy quality right but this is going to be faster and it's going to be real time"
7860560,7872640," without like any special cap cuts hopefully um okay so let me let me see so all right"
7874320,7885360," um okay is it rendering it's okay so essentially it's um you cannot see this but the speed is 0.5 that"
7885360,7891840," means instead of 30 seconds it's going to take a minute um right so it's going to actually take a"
7891840,7898240," minute i don't know but yeah i i hope that the slowness comes from the fact that it's"
7902320,7914560," that so it's and the file while reading input terminating the mixer threat and the file huh"
7914560,7926480," so and it's finished but it was not reporting appropriately that is bizarre okay so it generated"
7926480,7937280," some sort of an output it is correct though but on the in the standard output it was reporting some"
7937280,7945520," strange stuff oh okay i see what is going on so it it literally rendered like 10 seconds ah"
7945520,7952400," 10 seconds it's because of the 10 seconds we were trying to"
7953760,7963760," to put in okay freaking 10 seconds it's where to go uh where are they yeah okay i okay i see i see"
7963760,7970720," what is going on sure sure uh let's try to rebuild this and i think and uh let me let me see let's"
7970720,7976560," try to run it one more time let's try to run it one more time 10 seconds get them"
7978560,7987680," all right render so this time hopefully it will just like work properly hello is it what if it was"
7987680,7996320," working because of those stones 10 seconds all right whatever let's just wait so i hope that slowness"
7996320,8005680," uh is because maybe of wine implementation or something like that and actually on windows it is way faster"
8006960,8014240," i hope but who knows we'll see we'll see i'll definitely try to test these uh executable on"
8014240,8019040," windows as well just like a sanity check quick sanity check and maybe i'm going to then upload it"
8019040,8024400," to github uh in releases right so you can download it and stuff like that unfortunately it's going to"
8024400,8032240," be unsigned right because i don't know how to sign executables on windows i feel like it might actually cost"
8032240,8039680," money as well and i don't have any money so i don't know we'll see we'll see we'll see maybe there is a"
8039680,8054400," free like options to just sign sign up uh okay so he's doing things all right so we're done cool now let's"
8054400,8063760," take a look and see if it's full fully rendered uh just a second i think it's working right so"
8063760,8074640," yeah we it's it's past 10 seconds we fully rendered it so we have fully ported in usualizer for windows"
8078000,8080160," and we did that completely on linux"
8080160,8087520," that is bizarre the fact that they can just do that on linux it's kind of weird but i still need"
8087520,8090240," to test it on uh like on actual windows but still"
8092400,8099760," all right so i guess i proclaim today's session a success we had a couple of roadblocks with"
8099760,8107520," you know pipes and stuff like that but uh we still overcame them we still work in them anyway that's"
8107520,8112160," actually it for today thanks everyone who's watching right now really appreciate it have"
8112160,8116400," a good one and we'll see you on the next recreational as using session i love you"
