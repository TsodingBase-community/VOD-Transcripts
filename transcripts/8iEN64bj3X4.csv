0,2000," Mmm, all right"
2000,23280," Pogue cube your goddamn rap copycasted hello"
23280,29680," Hello, hello, maybe we should put some music on I suppose"
30000,32720," Let me send some smooth jazz"
32720,34720," Jazz"
34720,36720," Do you like jazz?"
36720,38720," Maybe"
38720,40720," Probably"
40720,42720," Quite likely"
42720,46720," Is that how you do that?"
46720,48720," I don't know how to use headphones"
48720,53760," What's up, my good duck"
53760,55760," What's up, what's up"
55760,59040," Welcome to the shit show"
59040,64160," So yeah let me make a cup of tea"
64160,68480," What's up, BeatStream"
68480,69120," Hello, hello"
72480,76560," Uh, so today is a friday if I'm not mistaken"
76560,77440," Am I?"
77440,78320," I think I'm not"
78320,80400," And anyways today"
80400,82960," That means today according to the schedule we're doing"
82960,83200," What?"
83200,86720," We're doing a random one-off stream"
86720,92320," On a random one-off stream I pick a random topic and I stream it for one stream"
92960,93680," Usually"
93680,96080," Well, sometimes it may actually span several streams"
96080,98800," But I don't think I'm going to spend too much time on this topic today"
98800,101280," So I just want to do a quick"
101280,103200," Uh, in and out"
103200,106240," On the topic just to check out these things"
106240,111600," So, uh, yeah, that's what we're going to be doing today"
111600,113600," We're going to be looking into Vulcan"
114240,117520," But, uh, under the prism of rust"
117520,119360," That's right"
119360,121840," I'm not going to be using some old sea"
121840,125840," I'm going to be using modern rust"
125840,126640," That's what we're going to do"
126640,130800," So, and, um, the wrapper"
130800,134080," The Vulcan wrapper that we're going to be using today is"
134880,136640," Uh, the vulcano, I think"
136640,140560," This is the thing that pops up in a search"
140560,143360," When I search, like, rust vulcan"
143360,145600," So, and it has a lot of stars"
145600,146480," That means it's good"
146480,147760," Right?"
147760,150640," So if it has a lot of stars, that means it's good"
150640,151760," So I decided to use it"
151760,152880," I checked it on my machine"
152880,154560," On my machine it works"
154560,155920," So if it works on my machine"
155920,157920," I can probably do something with it"
157920,158160," Right?"
158160,160720," I cannot do anything but things that don't work on my machine"
163840,165760," It is what it is and it isn't"
165760,166880," What it isn't"
166880,168400," Works for me"
168400,172160," Works in my machine"
172160,172880," God damn it"
172880,175920," Yeah, fucking damn it me"
175920,178640," Uh, hello everyone"
178640,179600," Hello, Kingslayer"
179600,182000," Hello, uh, LazyGrid"
182000,182320," John"
182320,184000," John"
184000,184640," Hello, hello"
184640,185440," How are you guys doing?"
185440,188320," How are you guys doing today?"
188320,189840," This is VKQ, by the way"
189840,190720," This is the"
191520,194480," demo that comes with Vulcan tools or something"
194480,195520," Right?"
195520,197120," And, uh, yeah"
197120,199680," Uh, so this is sort of like a"
199680,202720," Demonstration that Vulcan can work on my machine"
202720,206320," I had to, like, tweak some things in XOR configuration"
206320,208160," But after tweaking them"
208160,209920," Um, yeah, it's actually"
209920,210480," That should work"
210480,213120," So, yeah"
213120,216480," Um, so what exactly we're gonna do today?"
216480,217440," I don't know"
217440,220720," Maybe we're gonna try to render at least a triangle"
220720,221360," I've heard"
221360,223920," Rendering a triangle in Vulcan is hard enough"
223920,226960," So that I may have a content for not just one stream"
226960,228000," But maybe two streams"
228000,228800," So"
231600,232560," Uh, maybe"
232560,236880," I've just patched the kernel and it works"
236880,237200," Nice"
237200,239440," Oh, you mean me?"
239440,240560," No, I didn't patch the kernel"
240560,243920," I just put a couple of stuff to the configuration of XOR"
244800,246320," So I need to enable"
246320,248080," I need to enable something like"
248080,250880," Something that is called DRI3"
250880,253360," Whatever is that supposed to fucking mean?"
253360,255040," I don't know what is a DRI3"
255040,256720," I know nothing about computers"
256720,260320," But I enabled it in my XOR configuration"
260320,261600," And it just magically worked"
261600,263440," Go figure"
263440,264640," Go figure"
265280,267120," So I don't know if I can know"
267120,268000," Um, so"
268000,269120," I'm gonna go to the kitchen"
269120,270240," And turn on the kettle"
270240,271520," And I'm gonna be back"
271520,273760," TO THE CHAMPION OF THE ARENA"
295280,296240," I'm gonna go to the kitchen"
296240,297120," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
297120,298080," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
298080,299120," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
299120,300080," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
300080,301120," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
301120,302080," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
302080,303120," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
303120,304080," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
304080,305120," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
305120,306080," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
306080,307120," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
307120,308080," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
308080,309120," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
309120,310080," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
310080,311120," And then I'll go to the kitchen"
325280,340240," Let's get started, shall we?"
340240,341040," Let's get started"
341040,343520," GMCA"
343520,347760," Sweet, sweet sound of GMCA"
347760,348640," Love it"
348640,350240," Absolutely fucking love it"
350240,352240," So how are we gonna call"
352240,357440," How are we gonna call the project?"
357440,358240," Right"
358240,362880," That Trice, Rust and Vulcan"
362880,364880," So I'm not quite sure"
364880,367920," What's up, what's up?"
367920,368480," Hello, hello"
368480,371120," So we need to come up with a name"
371120,372000," So maybe"
372000,378320," Rust, Vulcan, Rulcan"
381760,386400," Alright, it's a good name"
386400,387040," Not gonna lie"
387040,388240," Let's do"
388240,390160," Do I need to actually update my Rust?"
390160,392240," Rust up update"
392240,393760," Let's see if I need to update anything"
393760,400480," Okay, so I'm using the latest Rust apparently"
400480,401840," So let's do cargo init"
401840,403440," Right, let's do cargo init"
403440,409120," So, and yeah"
409120,410800," So this is essentially what we have in here"
410800,413120," So it automatically created a git for me for some reason"
413120,413680," But okay"
413680,416480," Let me do cargo"
416480,417280," cargo toml"
417280,426320," See more keys and their definitions in here"
426320,427120," Thank you very much"
427120,429360," So my tea is ready by the way"
429360,433120," So I'm just gonna quickly pour a cup of tea"
433120,434000," And I'm gonna move back"
434000,435040," And I'm gonna move back"
435040,435520," Let's move back"
435520,436160," Let's move back"
462720,477600," So as I've already mentioned the binding that we're using today is the..."
477600,479360," It's called Vulcano"
479360,481440," Let's take a look at that binding"
481440,483440," And see if it's good or not"
485360,486160," I checked it out"
486160,487120," I checked it out a little bit off screen"
487120,489360," I just run a couple of examples on my machine"
489360,493440," just to check that this binding works at all on my machine"
493440,497280," So let me just copy paste this and that stuff"
497280,501520," And go to the page of Vulcano"
501520,506880," So this one seems to be the closest one to the original Vulcano"
506880,509120," You see it has 2.6k stars"
509120,514480," So yeah"
514480,519600," It's a Rust wrapper around the Vulcan Graphics API"
519600,521840," It follows the Rust philosophy"
521840,524560," Which is that as long as you don't use unsafe code"
524560,527840," You shouldn't be able to trigger any Undefined PE"
527840,530240," Okay"
531200,532400," In the case of Vulcan"
532400,536960," This means that non-safe code should always confirm to valid API usage"
536960,544960," But he doesn't act like a clown when he's not streaming"
544960,548240," Yeah"
548240,550080," Anyway"
550080,551760," So what I want to do"
551760,554400," I want to try to depend on this entire thing"
554400,556080," And just go through some of the examples"
557440,559440," So let's go to the crate"
559440,566160," Crate, crate, crate, crate, crate"
566160,566480," And"
566480,570640," Vulcano"
570640,577120," Okay"
577120,579360," So I think I should be able to just copy paste"
579360,581440," This thing"
581440,583120," I can just do it like that"
583120,585200," And put it into the dependencies"
585200,588160," And let's try to do cargo build"
588160,591520," And I think I already have like this entire thing pre-compiled"
591520,593200," So I didn't think it's going to take too much time"
593200,594560," Hopefully"
594560,596000," But yeah"
596000,603360," Well apparently it's going to recompile everything from scratch"
603360,606080," Smallvecppl"
606720,617760," Well I mean while we're waiting we can drink a cup of tea"
617760,621280," That's the point of modern technology"
621280,625120," That's the point of modern technology that takes a lot of time to compile"
625120,627520," So you can have excuses"
627520,630400," For your employer to not work"
630400,630640," Right"
630640,631600," And just drink some tea"
631600,635360," That's basically the whole point"
635360,638880," Rust compile times exactly"
638880,643520," That is basically the whole point"
650000,651680," Clown Fiesta already begins"
651680,652720," Oh okay"
652720,654160," So it took only one minute"
654160,655520," To just"
655520,657600," You know finish compiling this and that stuff"
657600,659520," But I mean I need to pour a cup of tea anyway"
659520,659680," So"
659680,662480," Let me quickly do that"
676480,687520," All right"
687520,689040," So let's do cargo run"
689040,690320," And see if it runs"
690320,691920," It says fellow world"
691920,693200," As you can see"
693200,696560," And let me see what we can do in here"
696560,698320," The thing I want to do"
698320,700240," I want to go to the examples"
700240,701920," And just do something with the examples"
702560,706240," So one of the examples that we have in here is the triangle"
706240,708960," So"
708960,710880," Yeah"
710880,714000," So the triangle takes"
714000,715920," 500 lines"
715920,719040," 555 lines in Rust"
719040,720640," Which is a little bit smaller than in C++"
720640,722160," Because in C++ as far as I know"
722160,726000," As far as I know it takes like 1000 lines of code"
726000,728800," So Rust is a little bit more concise than C++"
728800,730480," You see"
730480,734080," So if you google up Vulcan triangle example"
734080,734320," Right"
734320,736480," Vulcan triangle example"
736480,739360," And you open this thing up"
739360,742000," You will notice that this example"
742000,743040," Is"
743040,745440," Around 1000 lines of code"
745440,745600," Yeah"
745600,745840," Yeah"
745840,746720," It's a little bit more than"
746720,748000," 100 and"
748000,749760," 1000"
749760,752240," How English people say?"
752240,753040," 1200s"
753040,753200," Yeah"
753200,753760," Yeah"
753760,755200," English people say 1200s"
755200,755680," Right"
755680,756880," So it's 12-handed lines"
756880,759520," But this one is actually smaller"
759520,760960," So which is the ultimate proof"
760960,763920," That Rust is a better language"
763920,764960," Because it's more concise"
764960,766640," You can put more functionality"
766640,768000," In it"
768000,768560," Right"
768560,769600," They're doing the same thing"
769600,769760," Right"
769760,770640," They're doing the same thing"
770640,772240," But Rust code is smaller"
772240,773280," So"
773280,775200," It is what it is"
775200,776400," And it isn't what it isn't"
778640,782240," So let me see"
782240,782720," Let me see"
782720,788000," So"
788000,788960," Where's the entry point?"
788960,790720," In an entry point"
790720,791920," We do something called"
791920,794400," Vulcan win"
794400,796800," Whatever that's supposed to mean"
796800,798960," Okay let's actually read this description in here"
800320,802000," Maybe I might as well actually"
802000,804240," Okay"
804240,805920," The first step of any Vulcan program"
805920,807360," Is to create an instance"
807360,809280," When we create an instance"
809280,811520," We have to pass a list of extensions"
811520,812960," That we want to enable"
812960,814000," Right"
814000,814160," So"
814160,816720," All the window drawing functionalities"
816720,818720," Are part of non-core extensions"
818720,820480," That we need to enable manually"
820480,821040," To do so"
821040,821760," We ask"
821760,823200," Vulcanowin"
823200,824000," Create"
824000,825120," For the list of extensions"
825120,827120," Required to draw a window"
827120,828400," So we need to call to something"
828400,829920," Called Vulcanowin"
829920,830480," And"
830480,832000," Where can we find that?"
832000,833920," Vulcanowin"
833920,836560," So"
836560,840080," I don't see them"
840080,841680," Enabling it anywhere"
841680,841920," So"
841920,843600," Vulcanowin"
843600,844720," So they only enable"
844720,846320," VK surface build"
846320,846800," So"
846800,848640," I'm gonna just try to call this function"
848640,852800," Vulcanowin"
852800,856720," Oh my god"
856720,857520," Yeah"
857520,858240," Require extension"
858240,859520," Let's actually try to query"
859520,860320," All of the extensions"
860320,861440," And see what's gonna happen"
861440,862400," In this particular case"
862400,864960," So tense music"
864960,866080," Is the music too tense?"
866080,867760," I can switch it to something else"
867760,870400," So"
870400,872400," If the music is too much"
872400,873440," I can actually turn it off"
874480,875280," Is it better"
875280,875360," Is it better?"
875360,875360," Is it better?"
875360,875360," Is it better?"
875360,875360," Is it better?"
875360,876480," Is it better?"
876480,876480," Is it better?"
876480,876480," Is it better?"
876480,876480," Is it better?"
876480,876480," Is it better?"
876480,876480," Is it better?"
876480,876960," Is it better?"
876960,877040," Is it better?"
877040,877760," So just let me know"
877760,878720," If the music is too much"
878720,885600," Vulcan and let's try to run this entire thing"
885600,889520," Vulcan and let's try to run this entire thing"
889520,890320," And of course"
890320,890720," Of course"
890720,892400," We don't have"
892400,893440," Vulcanowin"
893440,895040," Because probably"
895040,896640," It's a completely separate crate"
896640,897920," That you have to depend on"
897920,898960," So"
898960,901520," Alright"
901520,903440," It's not enough to just enable Vulcanowin"
903440,904080," Right?"
904080,905600," So you need to separate"
905600,907440," Separate thing for this entire stuff"
907440,908000," Okay"
908000,911600," Let me see if we can get that crate from somewhere"
913360,915920," Vulcanowin"
915920,917680," Oh"
917680,918000," Okay"
918000,918320," There is"
918320,920240," Link between"
920240,920880," Vulcanowin"
920880,921360," And"
921360,922000," W"
922000,922400," Init"
922400,924080," So"
924080,925440," Let's just copy paste it"
925440,926240," In here"
926240,927440," And add it to"
927440,928720," The cargo"
928720,929360," Toml"
929360,929760," Something"
929760,930640," Something"
930640,931360," And here is"
931360,932400," Vulcanowin"
932400,933840," And"
933840,935040," We should be able to"
935040,936080," Compile this entire stuff"
936080,940480," Oh"
940480,940800," Yeah"
940800,941120," We need"
941120,941520," Okay"
941520,942080," Okay"
942080,942400," Sure"
942400,943840," We also need to compile the Vulcan"
943840,944480," Can't we?"
944480,968080," Own the TTF purse"
968080,972320," Why the name of this crate is so funny?"
972400,973040," Holy shit"
973040,974800," Why is it not pawned?"
974800,982160," I do understand what they were trying to say here"
982160,983600," But it just sounds so funny"
983600,983920," It's like"
983920,984880," Yeah"
984880,987040," I'm fucking installed on TTF parser"
987040,988880," Just fucking hacked all the way through"
988880,990000," Back door and stuff"
990000,995280," I don't know why it's so funny"
995280,996080," I think I need it"
996080,996080," I think I need it"
996080,996080," I think I need it"
996080,1001360," Oh"
1001360,1002640," We also have a package called"
1002640,1003040," Andrew"
1003040,1004400," I've always wondered"
1004400,1005680," What the fuck is Andrew?"
1005680,1007440," What the fuck is this package?"
1007440,1013040," Create provides a convenient drawing"
1013040,1014000," Ah"
1014000,1016080," So it's draw"
1016080,1017120," Okay"
1017120,1019920," Objects such as shapes, lines, text"
1019920,1020960," But why do I need"
1020960,1021520," Like I mean"
1021520,1023360," Isn't something"
1023360,1026080," Isn't this something that you're supposed to do yourself"
1026080,1028960," When you're working on such a low level of API?"
1028960,1029280," Right"
1029280,1030400," So you have shaders"
1030960,1034400," And you basically receive some vertex data from the shaders"
1034400,1038720," And you just draw whatever figures you want using mathematics"
1038720,1039760," Not Andrew"
1039760,1044800," Who's gonna win?"
1044800,1047520," The discipline of mathematics"
1047520,1049280," Or Andrew?"
1049280,1054240," By the way, yesterday I created a library called Jim"
1054240,1056960," So"
1056960,1059680," And I didn't know about Andrew when I was creating this library"
1059680,1061920," But this basically stands for json immediate"
1061920,1067520," It's a library for generating json in immediate mode similar to imgui"
1067520,1070480," And yeah, I created it yesterday for my needs"
1070480,1071600," And if anyone is interested"
1071600,1072880," So maybe you can check it out"
1072880,1074240," I just wanted to mention that"
1074240,1075760," There is a library, Andrew"
1075760,1077520," And I also have my own library called Jim"
1077520,1078960," So yeah"
1078960,1081760," All right"
1081760,1082080," So it's"
1082080,1083280," Holy shit"
1083280,1084720," It's still compiling by the way"
1084720,1086240," So it's still running"
1089680,1102960," So let me double check if I'm not running out of space"
1102960,1105280," I feel like I might run out of space"
1105280,1106800," It's actually kind of dangerous"
1106800,1110560," So I'm gonna split this screen a little bit"
1110560,1113680," And I'm gonna watch on df-h"
1113680,1116400," Just to make sure that I'm not running out of space"
1116400,1118720," Because I only have like 3 gigs in my home"
1119440,1122400," So I'm a little bit worried that"
1122400,1125600," We're gonna have some problems right in the stream"
1125600,1128400," Okay, so we apparently managed to compile everything"
1128400,1129120," So we have"
1129120,1131440," Queryed this thing successfully"
1131440,1132960," And one of the things I want to try to do"
1132960,1136400," One of the things I want to try to do"
1136400,1137520," I want you to try to"
1137520,1139920," Print those extensions"
1139920,1141920," Right, I want you to print those extensions"
1143600,1144160," All right"
1144160,1147840," So instance cannot be formatted with the formatter"
1147840,1150640," Okay, so maybe I have to actually print it in a debug mode"
1150640,1153280," So is it even print debuggable?"
1153280,1156000," Can I just see them at least?"
1156000,1161600," And okay, so these are the extensions that we have"
1161600,1164880," These are essentially all of the extensions that we have"
1164880,1165760," That's actually pretty cool"
1165760,1171040," All right, so let's go back to our example that we're working on"
1171040,1175440," We created all of these things and now I need to create an instance"
1175440,1176560," I need to create an instance"
1176560,1177600," You know what?"
1177600,1181040," I'm gonna actually grab this file in a row"
1181040,1183120," Right"
1183120,1188400," And I'm gonna put it somewhere here"
1188400,1190560," So I don't have to go to that website and I can"
1190560,1195360," You know, I can just open it locally on my machine"
1195360,1199200," All right, of course, I want to kind of remove the white spaces and stuff"
1199760,1201680," And where is my entry point?"
1201680,1202400," Yeah, instance"
1202400,1204560," So where do they take the instance?"
1204560,1205920," Do they get the instance from"
1205920,1207840," From somewhere?"
1207840,1209680," Yeah, it's a volcano instance"
1209680,1211680," So this is what they can take it from"
1211680,1213840," All right, let's try to do it like this"
1213840,1214240," I'm gonna"
1214240,1216960," Do this kind of stuff"
1216960,1221840," Instance new"
1226720,1231680," I wonder if I can take a look at the api docs for vulcano"
1231680,1233040," That would be actually kind of cool"
1233040,1233440," I think"
1233440,1236080," Can I take a look at the api docs?"
1236080,1237840," So"
1237840,1240720," Vulcano"
1240720,1243760," Maybe I can actually find some docs in here"
1243760,1246480," So there's a cargo cargo folder, right?"
1246480,1247600," And I probably can find"
1248480,1250320," Um, like a directory"
1250320,1251920," Find the type"
1251920,1254480," D3 with a name that contains vulcano"
1254480,1255360," Right"
1255360,1256800," And in that directory"
1256800,1257920," We might have"
1257920,1260080," Some documentation"
1260080,1262320," Okay, so here they are"
1262320,1263920," Uh, I can probably go there"
1263920,1265120," Find file at point"
1265120,1266320," Just go there"
1266320,1268160," And we have any docs in there?"
1268160,1270000," Okay, so we don't really have any docs in there"
1270000,1272560," And I wonder can we just generate docs"
1272560,1275280," With cargo doc or something for specific packages"
1275280,1276320," But locally"
1276320,1277440," You know what i'm talking about?"
1277440,1279120," Uh, you know what i'm talking about?"
1279120,1280640," Does anyone know how it's done?"
1280640,1281280," Probably"
1281280,1283040," Probably have to figure that out myself"
1283040,1285360," So i'm pretty sure"
1285360,1288000," There's something like cargo doc"
1288000,1290240," Right doc help"
1290240,1293280," All right, so"
1293280,1295520," Build the package documentation"
1295520,1296880," Can I specify the package?"
1298480,1298800," Okay"
1298800,1300640," Package to document"
1300640,1301360," Okay, so"
1301360,1306080," Can I do something like cargo doc?"
1306080,1308720," Oh, I already forgot"
1308720,1312160," Minus p"
1312160,1312480," Okay"
1312480,1316160," Minus p vulcano"
1316160,1317040," Okay"
1317040,1319520," So it's downloading everything"
1319520,1320880," And I wonder where it's gonna put that"
1320880,1322320," Like maybe it's gonna put it somewhere"
1322320,1327840," Documenting everything"
1327840,1329120," I also need to keep an eye"
1329120,1330560," On my on my home folder"
1330560,1331520," Just just a second"
1331520,1334880," I need to keep an eye on my home folder"
1334880,1342880," Okay"
1351680,1362160," Alright, so"
1362160,1362880," Where did it put it?"
1362880,1363600," Um"
1363600,1365120," Maybe it put it in"
1365120,1366240," Okay, so we have doc"
1366240,1370960," So do we have html"
1370960,1373120," Do we have an index html?"
1373120,1374720," I don't see index html"
1374720,1376000," Vulcano"
1376000,1377120," Okay, so we have vulcano"
1377120,1378000," Do we have an index?"
1378000,1380080," Yes, we do have an index html"
1380080,1380720," Yes, we do have an index html"
1380720,1394800," Here's the instance"
1394800,1399760," So we have a dark demon here by the way"
1399760,1402080," Can I have a dark demon 2020 please?"
1403040,1405920," What the fuck is this?"
1405920,1407680," Disgusting"
1407680,1409920," So preferred dark theme"
1409920,1411040," Wait"
1411040,1411520," Wait, what?"
1411520,1413680," Preferred dark theme"
1413680,1415040," Dark?"
1415040,1416320," Preferred light theme"
1420320,1434640," All right, so let me see"
1434640,1439280," Oh, the brush to the left"
1439280,1440800," Oh, yeah, okay"
1440800,1444480," But I guess it's"
1444480,1445600," Yeah, it does the same thing"
1446160,1447120," All right, whatever"
1447120,1447760," Doesn't matter"
1447760,1452400," Instant evoking context"
1452400,1452720," Okay"
1452720,1455120," So"
1455120,1457520," New"
1457520,1461920," Why"
1461920,1465600," I'm not in streamer mode"
1465600,1471520," Okay, just a second"
1471520,1473280," I need to switch to the streamer mode"
1473280,1479360," Yeah"
1479360,1482160," Okay"
1482160,1483280," So"
1483280,1489440," Fan new"
1489440,1490320," So"
1490320,1493280," App Infos"
1493280,1494960," Aha"
1497760,1498400," I think I need to"
1498400,1499760," Add to the sound of the app info"
1499760,1500720," And"
1500720,1502800," Maybe not"
1502800,1504400," Because everyone just says"
1504400,1505680," It puts a null in there"
1505680,1507120," So the only thing we need to have here"
1507120,1508000," Is an extension"
1508000,1509760," An extension is actually a generic thing"
1509760,1511200," So it could be anything"
1511200,1513440," Except it has to be a row instance extension"
1513440,1513680," Okay"
1513680,1515840," So it's something that is convertible"
1515840,1517280," To a row instance extension"
1517280,1518640," Uh"
1518640,1519120," I see"
1519120,1520000," I see"
1520000,1520400," All right"
1520400,1522800," Uh"
1522800,1525440," A row instance extension"
1525440,1526000," See over there"
1526000,1528800," All right"
1528800,1529440," I just wanted to"
1529440,1530720," I just wanted to see what's in there"
1530720,1532480," All right"
1532480,1536000," So"
1536000,1538960," Just keeping an eye on all of that stuff"
1538960,1539600," And"
1539600,1540560," Let me"
1540560,1541600," Go back in here"
1541600,1543120," And"
1543120,1544480," Let me see what we've got"
1544480,1545920," All right"
1545920,1547760," So we're gonna go back to the triangle"
1547760,1550080," And let's create an instance"
1550080,1550640," So"
1550640,1551440," To create an instance"
1551440,1551840," We do"
1551840,1552480," Instance"
1552480,1554960," New"
1554960,1555280," None"
1555280,1557760," Required extensions"
1557760,1558080," Right"
1558080,1559440," Required extensions"
1559440,1559760," None"
1559760,1562000," And I suppose we unwrap in here"
1562000,1563520," But we might as well actually put"
1563520,1564080," Expect"
1564080,1565040," Uh"
1565040,1566640," Expected"
1566640,1567360," To"
1567360,1568400," Create"
1568400,1570080," To create"
1570080,1571440," Uh"
1571440,1572800," A vulcan"
1572800,1573360," Instance"
1573360,1574960," But"
1574960,1576000," Too unlucky"
1576000,1576800," Right"
1576800,1578160," But too unlucky"
1578160,1579280," And here is an instance"
1579280,1580800," So there we go"
1580800,1581280," Uh"
1581280,1582880," After we're creating an instance"
1582880,1583520," Uh"
1583520,1584160," We wanna do"
1584160,1585840," Um"
1585840,1588160," We wanna just try to"
1588160,1588800," Run this into it"
1588800,1589040," I think"
1589040,1589920," And see what's gonna happen"
1589920,1590880," The car gonna run"
1590880,1598000," Okay"
1598000,1599840," It's kind of interesting that"
1599840,1600720," Intel Mesa"
1600720,1604080," Actually says this to standard output"
1604080,1605920," But we managed to create a vulcan instance"
1605920,1606480," Nonetheless"
1606480,1608000," We managed to create a vulcan instance"
1608000,1609680," Which is kind of poggers"
1609680,1610400," Not gonna lie"
1610400,1611920," Okay"
1611920,1615760," We then choose"
1615760,1617600," Which physical device to use"
1617600,1618720," Right"
1618720,1620880," In a real application"
1620880,1623200," There are three things to take into consideration"
1623200,1624880," Some devices"
1624880,1626400," May not support"
1626400,1628320," Some of the optional features"
1628320,1629520," That may be required"
1629520,1631280," By your application"
1631280,1632960," You should filter out the devices"
1632960,1634880," That do not support your app"
1634880,1638320," Not all devices can draw to a certain surface"
1638320,1639920," Once you create your window"
1639920,1641440," You have to choose a device"
1641440,1643520," That is capable of drawing to it"
1643520,1644960," You probably want to leave the choice"
1644960,1647280," Between the remaining devices to the user"
1647280,1648560," For the sake of the example"
1648560,1650560," We're just going to use the first device"
1650560,1651520," Which should work"
1651520,1653040," Most of the time"
1654160,1654720," Okay"
1654720,1654960," So"
1654960,1657520," I guess"
1657520,1658880," Yeah"
1658880,1660000," We take the instance"
1660000,1660160," And"
1660160,1662160," This is very interesting"
1662160,1663440," So we take a physical device"
1663440,1665600," And we enumerate it on the instance"
1665600,1667280," So that gives us an iterator"
1667280,1668400," Yeah"
1668400,1669440," That gives us an iterator"
1669440,1670320," And what I'm thinking is that"
1670320,1672720," We can try to iterate through all of the devices"
1672720,1674080," And just maybe collect them"
1674080,1675440," Into some vector"
1675440,1677920," And just print all of the devices that we have"
1677920,1678320," That is"
1678320,1679760," That are capable of drawing things"
1679760,1682400," So I think that will be interesting and educational"
1682400,1683520," Uh"
1683520,1683840," So"
1683840,1685200," Yeah"
1685200,1686720," Let's do physical"
1686720,1688160," Device"
1688160,1689920," Physical device"
1689920,1692720," Uh"
1692720,1693600," Enumerate"
1693600,1694720," So it gives us"
1694720,1696880," Physical device iterator"
1696880,1697840," Right"
1697840,1699200," Physical device iterator"
1699200,1699920," And"
1699920,1702240," The iterator should have an item"
1702240,1702480," Right"
1702480,1704960," It should have a particular item set to something"
1704960,1705840," But I cannot see it"
1705840,1708640," Because I'm incapable of reading"
1708640,1710400," The documentation of this stuff"
1710400,1711920," Unless I go to the source code"
1711920,1713600," And in the source code"
1713600,1715600," Yeah"
1715600,1717680," It's just the iterator over physical devices"
1717680,1718960," All right"
1718960,1719760," So that makes sense"
1719760,1723200," That make sense"
1723200,1723520," So"
1723520,1726960," Let me go to my thingy-ma-jingy"
1726960,1728880," So"
1728880,1730640," For device"
1730640,1731840," In physical"
1731840,1733040," Device"
1733040,1734480," Enumerate"
1734480,1735280," Enumerate"
1735280,1735440," Enumerate"
1735440,1737360," And we're going to provide a pointer to an instance"
1737360,1738080," Right"
1738080,1739280," What we're going to be doing here"
1739280,1739680," Uh"
1739680,1741920," Maybe we're going to print something like println"
1741920,1743200," Uh"
1743200,1743760," Physical"
1743760,1745760," Physical devices"
1745760,1747280," Uh"
1747280,1748000," We found"
1748000,1748720," Right"
1748720,1749600," Something like this"
1749600,1751120," And we're going to print them like so"
1751120,1753040," So"
1753040,1754080," This is going to be the name"
1754080,1754560," Right"
1754560,1755600," And then"
1755600,1757360," I suppose the type"
1757360,1758480," Right"
1758480,1761440," And in this particular case type is only debuggable"
1761440,1762400," Uh"
1762400,1762720," So"
1762720,1764880," Device name"
1764880,1767040," And device type"
1767040,1767840," That's what's going to be"
1767840,1768800," We're going to have"
1768800,1770320," All right"
1770320,1770560," So"
1770560,1771200," Uh"
1771200,1772080," Let's try to"
1772080,1772960," Uh"
1772960,1773520," Run this into"
1773520,1773920," I think"
1773920,1775280," And it does not compile"
1775280,1777360," Because I probably need to take"
1777360,1777760," Uh"
1777760,1778000," And"
1778000,1778480," Uh"
1778480,1779760," Import physical device"
1779760,1780240," From"
1780240,1780560," Yeah"
1780560,1780880," From"
1780880,1781680," From the instance"
1781680,1782000," Right"
1782000,1783200," I have to import it from the"
1783200,1784080," Uh"
1784080,1784720," From here"
1784720,1786000," Uh"
1786000,1786480," All right"
1786480,1786880," So"
1786880,1788480," Let's quickly do that"
1788480,1790720," I think I can just run it from any place"
1790720,1790960," Yeah"
1790960,1792480," I should be able to run it from any place"
1792480,1793280," Okay"
1793280,1796640," Okay"
1796640,1799360," We only found one"
1799360,1801760," Interesting"
1801760,1803120," So"
1803120,1804320," Oh"
1804320,1805040," That's actually pretty cool"
1805040,1807040," So if you have several GPUs"
1807040,1811680," These GPUs are going to be in the enumeration of these physical devices"
1811680,1815840," And you will be able to explicitly just choose which device you want"
1815840,1818400," And your application will be able to show a menu"
1818400,1821680," We found these devices that support Vulcan"
1821680,1822720," Which one do you want to use"
1822720,1824160," Which graphics card you want to use"
1824160,1826400," Or you maybe you want to switch in runtime"
1826400,1826640," Right"
1826640,1828960," So you just can pick it and just use it"
1828960,1831200," So isn't it cool?"
1831200,1831920," Isn't it cool?"
1831920,1833120," I think it's pretty good and cool"
1833120,1833520," Isn't it?"
1833520,1836480," Um"
1840480,1843920," What other fields fields do we have in a physical device?"
1843920,1848000," So I only now I only know name and type"
1848000,1851600," So let me see so here's a physical device"
1851600,1856240," Memory heaps"
1856240,1857680," Limits"
1857680,1863520," That's a lot of interesting thing things"
1865360,1866240," API version"
1866240,1869680," So an API version gives you"
1869680,1872400," A represent a version of Vulcan"
1872400,1873440," Okay"
1873440,1876560," There's also driver version"
1876560,1879920," Which is just a number"
1879920,1882960," Extension properties"
1882960,1884960," Limits"
1884960,1888080," So give access to the limits of the physical device"
1888080,1890080," I want to take a take a look at the limits to be fair"
1890720,1891040," Um"
1891040,1892400," Oh shit, that's"
1892400,1899280," That is actually pretty cool"
1899280,1902320," That is a very type safe of doing that"
1902320,1904560," Right"
1904560,1906800," So you have a type of a physical device"
1906800,1911600," And then of that physical device you can query some things"
1911600,1912400," Uh"
1912400,1918800," For example, I want to know in on my graphics card like how many vertex input attributes can I have"
1919920,1921760," Let's let's just query that like why not?"
1921760,1924080," Let's just query that"
1924080,1926320," It's actually very interesting"
1926320,1930320," So we have a name and we can do something like println"
1930320,1936160," And this one is going to be I wish I could quickly copy paste this kind of stuff"
1937760,1944880," Um, so it's going to be something like this equal to this and it's going to be device uh limits"
1944880,1949520," Limits and it's going to be something like this"
1949520,1953840," Right, so let's see what do we have in here?"
1953840,1956160," So I'm probably not going to compile probably fucked up something"
1956160,1957840," Uh syntactically"
1957840,1960000," Roken"
1960000,1962000," 28"
1962000,1967680," So I cannot create more than 28 input attributes which kind of makes sense like why would you need so many attributes?"
1967680,1971280," Um, right, it's usually and"
1971280,1972320," Yeah"
1972320,1974640," Because if you have"
1974640,1978000," Yeah, you need an array of"
1978000,1983120," Floats array of two-dimensional vectors array of three-dimensional vectors four-dimensional vectors and"
1983680,1988480," Maybe maybe more of this kind of thing you don't need too many vertex attributes to be fair"
1988480,1990400," So that that kind of makes sense"
1990400,1993360," Well, is there anything about textures?"
1993360,1995760," Uh, nothing about textures though"
1997840,2000320," Uh max viewports"
2000320,2002160," Um"
2002160,2005040," Is there something about memory?"
2005040,2007440," Uh memory allocation count?"
2007440,2008720," Huh?"
2008720,2010960," Memory"
2010960,2014960," Yeah, so memory allocation count. Let's let's take a look at memory allocation count"
2014960,2022800," Uh, I wonder if we can just print all of the limits. I wonder if we can just print all of them"
2026080,2028080," So let's move this way"
2028080,2029840," So we don't have to check anything"
2029840,2038880," So let's print all of the links and uh, uh, let's see if it's going to compile"
2038880,2044960," Uh links cannot be formatted because doesn't okay. So it can be just easily formatted"
2044960,2051040," Uh, all right, whatever so let's continue so we need to pick uh"
2051040,2055600," Some sort of like a physical device the first one that is appears there"
2056960,2063040," The first one that appears there. Uh, so let me see. Let me see. It's going to be fn main"
2063040,2065760," um"
2065760,2073280," So, yeah, so the the thing that the example does the thing that example does it just like takes the first one"
2074000,2079920," Uh, physical uh physical uh physical device device enumerate"
2079920,2083920," Uh instance on an instance next"
2083920,2087920," unwrap right and then"
2089040,2091280," We can print the the device we found"
2091280,2104480," Physical name all right that makes sense"
2104480,2108560," The objective of this example is to draw a triangle on a window"
2108560,2112560," To do so we first need to create the window"
2112960,2117840," This is done by creating a window builder from the w init crate"
2117840,2123120," Then calling the build vk surface method provided by the vk surface build trait from vulcano win"
2123120,2127280," If you ever get an error about build vk surface being undefined"
2127280,2131600," In one of your project, this probably means that you forgot to import this trait"
2131600,2135120," Uh, okay. Thank you so much for telling me that that's actually pretty cool"
2135920,2144960," This returns a vulcana swap chain surface object that contains both cross-platform w init a window and cross-platform vulcan surface representing the surface of the window"
2144960,2145440," Okay"
2145440,2151840," So w init is something that is needed for initializing the vulcan usually so let me let me take a look at this stuff stuff"
2151840,2156880," Uh w init"
2162880,2166080," So cross-platform window creation and management in rust"
2166080,2176000," I wonder if we have to explicitly depend on it"
2176000,2178640," I probably will have to yeah, so"
2178640,2181760," We won't be able to create this event loop"
2181760,2185520," Uh, as you can see here without w init"
2185520,2189680," Yeah, so let me try to do that and just see what's going to happen"
2190160,2193200," Yeah, it will tell me that uh, this thing is undeclared, okay"
2193200,2197360," Um, so then i'm gonna go to the triangle right to the triangle"
2197360,2203120," And uh, event uh loop right event loop is available in here"
2203120,2206560," Event loop is available in here"
2206560,2211920," And uh, let me see what we've got in here. So we only need event loop"
2213760,2217360," So something like this and it's probably also not going to compile"
2217360,2218800," Uh, because"
2218800,2224560," Yeah, we need to have that in the dependencies. So we need to put it into the cargo tomo as well"
2224560,2232320," Um, so the latest version is w e 24. I'm wonder if it's going to be compatible with with those things"
2232320,2235760," But maybe I have to use 22 or something"
2236560,2243120," Um, yeah, let's try to use 22. Maybe maybe everything has to be 22. Uh, let's give it a try and see if it's gonna"
2243120,2248640," It's gonna work. All right. I also need to keep an eye on my uh hardware hard drive usage"
2248640,2252800," Hmm"
2258720,2265360," Um, why are you querying your eye gpu because I can do that with vulcan"
2265360,2268240," um, so"
2268240,2279680," So basically i'm just what i'm doing right now i'm just exploring vulcan"
2279680,2287920," And uh, i'm just seeing what kind of uh functions this library provides and i'm just looking into them, right?"
2287920,2294720," So one of the functions that it provides it provides me to take all of the physical devices that support vulcan and look at them"
2294720,2298560," So and they decided like why not look at them"
2298560,2306240," Right, isn't that what makes the programmer programmer the the curiosity right you find something interesting you try it out"
2306240,2308800," See if you can learn something about it like"
2308800,2314720," Like I didn't usually ask why I just see a function call that gives me some information"
2315120,2318000," Why not just call it on my machine and just see what's gonna happen?"
2318000,2323760," I mean isn't that the beauty of programming isn't that why we're programming at all"
2323760,2329840," Just so we can see some interesting api function in the documentation and just call it and see what's gonna happen"
2329840,2333360," I personally programming because of that. I don't know about you guys"
2333360,2335920," but yeah"
2335920,2340080," It's like I don't usually ask why because because i'm a programmer that's that's what I do"
2340080,2347200," um"
2349440,2352240," Why are you doing that because I cannot make it work on my"
2352240,2356480," Um on my setup. It's just debian being debian"
2356480,2358720," Uh, so yeah"
2359600,2361600," And unfortunately, um"
2361600,2365200," Um, yeah"
2365200,2370480," Uh when I queried all of the devices that support vulcan only"
2370480,2373440," Integrated ones showed up so"
2373440,2380240," Nothing much you can do nothing much you can do so i'm kind of limited with uh with what I can do in here"
2380240,2382000," But in any case we managed to create event"
2384160,2390160," We managed to create event loop, which is kind of cool and uh, let me see what's going to be the next thing"
2390160,2392160," So it's going to be event a loop"
2392160,2393680," Right"
2393680,2395920," And the next thing we need to do we need to create a surface"
2395920,2398240," Uh"
2398240,2402640," So that's and we have to clone the instance. That's very interesting"
2402640,2405360," We have to clone the instance"
2405360,2409040," All right, so can I take a look at"
2409040,2410640," Uh"
2410640,2413600," At the documentation somewhere here. Do I have w init?"
2413600,2424320," I wonder can I just do cargo doc and hope that it will rebuild all of the documentation for all of my packages?"
2424320,2430880," I think it's I think it's gonna do that. Okay, so it's documented everything. I think I think that's actually a pretty good idea"
2430880,2434640," Yeah, so let's just document everything and just use the local documentation"
2434640,2438560," Um"
2440640,2468720," I think that's pretty accurate. I'm not gonna lie. That is very very accurate, but yeah"
2470400,2472400," Uh, so yeah"
2472400,2477040," Nyx"
2477040,2479760," Interesting is that what is nyx though?"
2479760,2480560," Nom"
2480560,2484800," Man, I love the names of these packages"
2484800,2490640," So what about nom?"
2490640,2493360," What about nom? Let me see"
2493360,2497040," Uh, by the range it's zero copy parser combinators slow"
2500160,2506240," You need a parser combinator in your vulcan application"
2506240,2508160," That's that's for sure"
2508160,2512480," Oh"
2522640,2526800," Because how are we supposed to parse shit in your graphical application?"
2526800,2533440," And of course, Andrew don't forget the engine"
2533440,2537600," Don't forget the don't forget the entry"
2537600,2542800," What the heck is this? I have no idea. I'm trying to document all of my dependencies"
2544320,2544720," Um"
2544720,2550560," Also, I need to keep track on my on my hard drive"
2556000,2556560," Um..."
2556560,2556560," Um..."
2556560,2556560," Um..."
2556560,2557040," Um..."
2557040,2557600," Um..."
2557600,2557600," Um..."
2557600,2558000," Um..."
2558000,2558000," Um..."
2586000,2598560," Okay, uh, so, uh, we have docs, right?"
2598560,2599440," Do we have w"
2599440,2604160," Uh, w in there we go. Here is a w unit"
2606000,2607680," And let's open this entire shot"
2607680,2610640," Um..."
2610640,2614880," So what I wanted to take a look at is I suppose the window builder, right?"
2614880,2616720," So I wanted to take a look at the window builder"
2618240,2623760," uh yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep"
2623760,2632800," window builder window build them okay uh yes"
2632800,2646240," i'm just not not sure why you have to clone the instance to to build this but okay"
2647760,2656480," build vk surface um let me see build vk surface yeah here it is"
2656480,2667280," it's part of a trade uh so uh the problem is that i don't know how arc works what is arc"
2667280,2670800," oh it's a reference counting pointer i see"
2673040,2677680," atomically reference counted i see and that makes sense okay sure"
2677680,2688000," okay okay okay so main dot rs and let's do let's create the surface so it's going to be window"
2688000,2695280," builder uh new and then we're going to build vk surface uh we're going to provide the event loop"
2695920,2700880," and then we're going to provide the instance and we're going to also clone it there we go so and all"
2700880,2713440," of that of course has to be abrupt expected um to um expect it to create a window a window for vulcan"
2714080,2721600," instance but too unlucky to unlock and let's just have a surface"
2721600,2729200," i wonder if i can print this maybe so maybe that will automatically create the window uh we'll see we'll"
2729200,2736080," see so let's just try to run this entire stuff it doesn't compile because we don't have a windows uh"
2736080,2745200," builder probably because i have to use it all right i have to use it uh so let's put this window with"
2745200,2752160," windows builder window builder um all right"
2752160,2762800," uh no window builder ah okay so just a second let me see what where is the window builder window"
2764160,2767600," builder builder yeah it has to be part of the window"
2767600,2775440," uh use the init uh window let's put it here"
2775440,2779600," all right"
2779600,2782720," mm-hmm"
2782720,2791440," mm-hmm"
2794160,2799920," a method not found on window oh yeah i remember the triangle actually set"
2799920,2815520," undefined yeah"
2815520,2823600," so to fix the problem that i have right now the problem is that i don't have a build vk surface"
2824320,2828320," right so i have to include that luckily oh"
2828320,2832720," shit um luckily they documented that so i really appreciate it"
2832720,2834880," uh"
2834880,2840400," i would never guess that but i mean it didn't it didn't help anyway so"
2840400,2843200," um"
2847920,2851600," all right so let me let me see what's going on here triangle"
2851600,2860960," uh this returns uh oh yeah wait a second uh i'm i'm and problem is that you forgot to import"
2860960,2868720," this trait oh yeah i'm an idiot uh method provided by the case of his build trade from vulcano win"
2869520,2875280," uh so yeah i need to import this one yeah okay okay so i need to import this one and it's going to be"
2875280,2879040," that one all right so uh let me see"
2881840,2883120," uh"
2883120,2884320," uh"
2884320,2888720," not found in this did i already remove that"
2888720,2894880," wait a second did i remove that i managed it i think i think removed so it's going to be window"
2894880,2897920," window builder window builder"
2900720,2904960," okay so and we don't need this thing anymore"
2904960,2909680," uh"
2909680,2913120," all right just give me a break"
2913120,2919520," i really need new glasses to be fair i really need new glasses"
2923840,2930000," okay let's start over let's start over build vk surface right so what does it say"
2930000,2937680," uh provided by vk surface build trade from vulcano if you get an error about uh being credit okay so"
2937680,2943920," that means you need vk surface build which i included okay so but maybe i have to"
2943920,2950080," yeah i mean i copy pasted this entire thing from here so that means everything should be okay"
2950800,2958480," uh this returns object okay so what's the problem do we have uh all right"
2958480,2969840," so unused import so and that didn't help at all that didn't help at all"
2969840,2975760," uh all right so let's make a cup of tea i think i need a small break"
2980800,2994400," hmm do you guys have any questions while i'm gonna be making a cup of tea"
3000320,3027040," turn the life thank you so much for subscribing with twitch prime thank you thank you thank you and"
3027040,3033920," welcome to our epic vulcan club let's talk a full post about the exact problem okay i'm i'm i will"
3033920,3036560," look into that a little bit later i'll try to google that um"
3042400,3067200," thank you thank you so much for uh seven months of twitch prime subscription that's that's really epic"
3067920,3078720," uh and welcome to our epic sodium juice club i'm sorry i can't help myself"
3078720,3089360," all right so i want chocolate to be fair i want a little bit of chocolate but unfortunately i ran out of"
3089360,3097840," with yesterday yesterday yesterday all my troubles seem so far i'm sorry okay so i'm gonna go to the"
3097840,3105280," kitchen and just make a cup of tea and i mean turn on my kettle and uh i'm gonna be back soon uh making"
3105280,3121760," cup of tea right making cup of tea um all right so just a second just a second"
3125760,3136640," um"
3136640,3138640," um"
3138640,3140640," um"
3140640,3146640," um"
3146640,3159520," okay"
3159520,3170480," okay so one of the hypotheses that i have is um that maybe there is a uh version is incorrect um right"
3172640,3179520," version is incorrect uh so what we can do we can check out what version is used in in there"
3179520,3185840," right what version is using them uh so in the examples specifically because examples do have"
3185840,3191440," their own tomo right they do have their own tomo file uh and we can just check them out"
3193040,3200240," w in it is 24 interesting so vulcana that is used in here is this one but w need is 24."
3200240,3201040," uh"
3201040,3205120," uh"
3205120,3221760," uh thanks for interesting stream setting i'm still a beginner in many things but still suck some"
3221760,3228880," information up here gotcha hyper and there and i'm too dumb for emacs i realized uh thank you thank you"
3228880,3235040," so much for two months of tier one subscription uh speaking of emacs uh just keep in mind that uh like"
3235040,3242720," one important piece of information uh editor does not make you a better developer uh so that's the only"
3242720,3248960," thing you need to know about emacs right so every time you have doubts what uh what editor should i use"
3248960,3254640," for that and that is vim a good option is emacs good option just remember one simple thing editor"
3254640,3259760," doesn't make you a better developer that's it conversation is over it's just it's just said"
3259760,3266320," there's nothing to discuss in here like it just doesn't make you a better developer um so it is what"
3266320,3273440," just a token of gratitude just a second uh my my tea is ready"
3273440,3286560," because of you now i live not a little bit about real programming state it compilet language"
3286560,3296000," just a token of gratitude for your streams because of you now i learned a little bit uh about a real pro"
3296000,3316960," what is real programming uh static compile language uh i don't know what is the real programming but"
3316960,3322800," thank you so much for six months of twitch prime subscription thank you thank you thank you uh so"
3322800,3334240," all right um is there like imaginary programming yeah so probably if there's a real program there must be"
3334240,3339440," an imaginary one uh so who knows but i'm glad that you're learning real programming whatever that's"
3339440,3351120," supposed to mean uh so all right uh let me let me see uh so they are using w init uh 24."
3351120,3355120," uh so let's actually try to use also w need 24."
3355120,3361760," uh so let me let me see let me let me try to run that and maybe that was going to be a little bit better"
3362160,3375440," uh okay so okay so i guess we know what was the problem so wait"
3375440,3381040," did you see that it blinked"
3381040,3390560," that means it briefly created a window and then it exited and the window got destroyed"
3392160,3399440," so uh all right so uh let's take a look at this stuff um"
3399440,3408720," the next step is to choose which gpu queue will execute our draw commands"
3408720,3416160," devices can provide multiple queues to run commands in parallel for example a draw queue and a compute queue"
3416880,3424240," similar to cpu threads this is uh something we have to uh manage manually in vulcan in a real life"
3424240,3431440," application we would probably use at least a graphics queue and a transfers queue to handle data transfers"
3431440,3438880," in parallel in this example we only use one queue we have to choose which queues to use early on because"
3438880,3448800," we'll need this info very soon okay so we don't not only have um queue we we have the whole queue families"
3448800,3455360," it's a family friendly api it has queue families i have no idea what that's supposed to mean but let's"
3455360,3466960," actually read more about that uh to do to so um family friendly api finally so um we probably have to have"
3466960,3476000," uh so let me close all of this stuff because it's uh uh is this what i think it is this is a vulcan"
3476000,3482160," okay so we need to have a physical device right so here's a physical device"
3482160,3492400," and uh in here we should have something like q families right so it gives us a q family iterator"
3493040,3499600," uh all right that we can try to iterate uh for all q families available on a physical device"
3499600,3508000," it's kind of strange that for different kinds of iterators you have to have like a separate type"
3508000,3515200," or something but maybe oh maybe iterator is actually yeah i see that um"
3518000,3523280," all right all right so let's do the following thing let's actually try to iterate through all of the"
3523280,3528480," uh through all of the families and see how many of them we have and what kind of families we have"
3528480,3541600," so uh let me see so for a family in physical physical q families physical q families"
3544560,3551360," so i need to take a look at a single family all right so where is the item it's kind of strange"
3551360,3561600," that i cannot just look up easily an item for the iterator um like i have an iterator uh thingy"
3561600,3570240," but i don't see an item definition on the page so for me to find an item definition i have to go to the"
3570240,3577200," source code find the implementation of an iterator and find that it's q family uh but maybe i can"
3577200,3584880," oh i think i can unfold this okay so i have to unfold the implementation okay and then click on this"
3584880,3591520," stuff but a control f doesn't make it easier to to work with unfortunately um i wonder if this thing is"
3591520,3599280," like printable or at least debuggable i think it should be um i think it should be let me see is it"
3599280,3606320," debug yes it is debuggable so that means i should be able to do something like print uh like this right"
3606320,3614000," and let's just do family and see what's gonna happen uh all right so how many family cues"
3614000,3618640," do we have in here show me show me show me all your family cues"
3618640,3628720," okay so we've got only one i think so q family physical device is that um"
3634160,3640720," so there's only literally one that's very strange so and how can we know what kind of q is that"
3640720,3649440," um supports graphics oh we can actually check if it supports graphics and supports compute uh let's"
3649440,3662960," actually see uh graphics uh family supports uh graphics right and then compute uh supports compute"
3664160,3668640," um so i don't know if it's gonna give us any like uh useful information about this kind of stuff"
3668640,3668640," uh"
3668640,3670640," uh"
3670640,3679520," why does it take so much time to compile it it's just really strange"
3679520,3683680," oh it supports both graphics and compute would you look at that"
3683680,3687920," uh supports both graphics and compute"
3687920,3691520," whatever's that supposed to mean uh but okay"
3693200,3701040," uh cues cut ah it's a family so it means it for some reason i thought that it's a single cue"
3701040,3708480," uh but it has several cues inside of it because it's a cue family okay okay that makes sense i'm an idiot"
3708480,3714160," so and that's why you can have a count for the cues so we can have cues count right so uh"
3714160,3718160," let's do something cues count um"
3720240,3728960," cues count family uh cues count uh and let's let's see what's gonna happen"
3740960,3742800," um"
3742800,3746240," seductress that's the name of the song"
3746240,3749680," cues count one but we have only one cue"
3749680,3751680," uh"
3751680,3760400," trust is my seductress"
3760400,3768960," uh let's continue um so"
3768960,3775200," uh so we find the one"
3776400,3782240," what we find the one that supports graphics"
3782240,3783280," and"
3783280,3786320," is supported by our surface"
3786320,3789440," hmm that's very interesting"
3789440,3801120," it's a great amount yes it is a great amount very lucky i don't remember who suggested it uh"
3801120,3805520," i think it was super cuba who suggested it but maybe somebody else uh but yeah it was a long time ago"
3805520,3807120," actually"
3807120,3810960," it's a very good good month"
3818640,3823280," just a second chat i just have a mild panic attack so you need to"
3823280,3839360," regardless my thoughts um and i'm gonna continue i'm gonna continue doing this stuff"
3842320,3845440," so it's kind of strange like i have a pretty"
3845440,3852000," yeah the reason probably this graphics card doesn't support is because it's intel and oh probably not"
3852000,3858240," because it's intel but because the support message support is incomplete because you see every time i run"
3858240,3866080," this application it says that the uh support is incomplete and maybe it's already complete but i'm"
3866080,3872720," using debian uh which has like a very outdated software so yeah maybe if i switch to something"
3872720,3876960," like arch i'm actually like legit considering switching to arch because"
3876960,3885600," i'm kind of tired of debian and its old software and yeah i don't know we'll see we'll see"
3888480,3892800," but i'm too lazy to upgrade like every day and fix the problems every day"
3892800,3900320," so i probably won't do that because i like my system like i like to configure system once"
3900320,3905840," and just forget about it uh like completely like it exists don't touch it don't update it's just like"
3905840,3912880," it works don't touch it um so i think you can do the same thing with arch but at some point like"
3912880,3921520," you won't be able to update i haven't updated i do my boxes a month yeah that's what i'm scared of if"
3921520,3927920," you miss a single day you might as well uh reinstall it from scratch yeah it's just like just reinstall"
3927920,3932560," from scratch i mean it's just not worth the time but i mean i tried uh arch really long time ago"
3932560,3939760," um when i only was getting into linux um so maybe the situation changed there i don't know"
3942880,3948480," i tried a lot of different districts i tried a lot of them uh i'm kind of tired of switching between"
3948480,3956000," them all right so uh let's continue let's continue let's continue um so triangle right so we need to"
3956000,3958480," find the first one"
3963040,3972800," find them so and we accept the queue by a reference i always want to call the pointer but it kind of is"
3972800,3988160," a pointer supports graphics and the surface is supported uh by this queue and this entire thing"
3988960,3997040," oh yeah so this is kind of strange that the surface may return it returns wait a second"
3997040,4001840," are you serious um"
4001840,4011360," um so this is a vulcan this is another vulcan"
4014400,4017440," uh okay i probably have to do something like"
4017440,4023360," uh target docs w in it"
4023360,4035280," and we'll build them okay"
4041280,4043600," okay is supported is not even part of this thing"
4043600,4049360," it's part of the surface"
4049360,4060080," okay so here's the strange thing uh checking for a support may fail returns true if the given queue"
4060080,4067360," family can draw so and what can fail while okay so maybe you're querying the support and querying the"
4067360,4074640," support may fail okay that that makes sense okay keep it but it's not uh so one of the things you can"
4074640,4080560," have in here is not enough memory or the surface is no longer accessible and must be recreated"
4080560,4089760," okay so yeah sometimes you may not even uh be able to query a certain capabilities or certain supports"
4089760,4095360," okay that that makes sense that's why uh it returns the result that's why it returns the result"
4095360,4100320," okay that makes sense to me that makes sense to me"
4100320,4106560," ah okay so um"
4106560,4121680," unwrap or false right so and after that uh we're gonna do something like unwrap and that gives us the"
4122560,4124240," the q family that we want to work with"
4124240,4142080," cool so after we created the q family now initializing the device this is probably the most"
4142080,4150480," important object of vulcan the most important one we have to pass five parameters when creating a device"
4150480,4157600," which physical device to uh to connect to a list of optional features and extensions that our program"
4157600,4164000," need to work uh needs to work correctly some parts of the vulcan specs are optional and must be enabled"
4164000,4171040," manually at device creation in this example the only thing we are creating uh we are going to need is the"
4171040,4183600," khr swap chain i guess it's the name of the uh of the vulcan thingy so what are"
4183600,4191280," okay uh it's kind of funny that the first thing is like points to reddit"
4192880,4199440," of the five parameters for an amateur yeah exactly uh sorry i'm a bit of a graphic snoob does this have"
4199440,4206480," something to do with double buffering google explanation could be found here okay so on the intel"
4206480,4217440," website uh api without secrets introduction to vulcan part two swap chain okay um welcome to the second vulcan"
4217440,4224720," tutorial in the first tutorial i discussed basic vulcan setup function loading instance creation"
4224720,4230080," choosing a physical device in queue and the logical device creation i'm sure you now want"
4230080,4236000," to draw something unfortunately we must wait until the next part what like tutorial two"
4236560,4245360," tutorial two and we haven't drawn anything yet but yeah uh anyway so in vulcan a swap chain is an"
4245360,4252720," extension why isn't it obvious we want to display an image on the screen in our application windows well"
4252720,4258000," it's not well i do agree that it's not obvious because vulcan is also a compute api right so that means"
4258000,4264480," some vulcan application may never display anything on the screen you know what i'm talking about right if"
4264480,4272560," they only use compute and we know why you may want to use only compute and not graphics we know we know who"
4272560,4286320," you are okay so um but uh yeah so this situation may happen anyways um asking for chain"
4289440,4297520," okay i guess swap chain is basically double buffering is it not i think i think is it is it not i think it is"
4297520,4310720," all right um you can show some attention a list of uh a list of layers to enable this is very niche"
4310720,4317440," and you'll uh usually pass none the list of cues that we are going to use the exact parameter is an"
4317440,4325680," iterator whose items are qf32 where the 40 point represents the priority of the queue okay between"
4325680,4331120," zero and one the priority of the queue is a hint to the implementation about how much it should prioritize"
4331120,4337680," the cues between one another so cues if i understand correctly cues are basically like threats of the gpu"
4337680,4347200," right and you can yeah essentially threads of the gpu um so the list of created uh cues is returned by the"
4347200,4349360," function alongside with the device okay"
4352160,4358800," device extensions uh oh this is very interesting so"
4358800,4369920," yeah it's sort of like um yeah it's extending the the record extending the record uh thing"
4369920,4378800," i need to make a small break chat i really need to make a small break like already three minutes and after"
4378800,4385920," three minutes we're going to continue just just a second um all right"

4584960,4584960," uh"
4584960,4596960," so"
4596960,4608960," yo what's up everyone how everyone is doing welcome back to back"
4611040,4617680," um so device extensions uh where do we get device extensions let's take a look at uh at it so it's"
4617680,4634880," part of the volcano uh to the tune um so okay device extensions and can i go oh okay i can actually just"
4634880,4644000," use oh okay so i can just use it like that and then go there ah so device extension swap chain"
4644000,4649120," and there are a bunch of booleans that is really strange like what if i"
4649120,4651600," huh"
4651600,4661920," what if there will be new extensions but i'm using an old vulcan ah but maybe you just upgrade the version"
4661920,4666080," of vulcan and new extensions are going to be available for for you there or something like that"
4666080,4673040," i guess it does make sense so device extension is just a list of extensions that enabled or"
4673040,4679200," available okay uh displays for chains so chain blah blah blah so i guess we just have to do that"
4679200,4687760," um all right so let's go to to main in here and device extensions right device extensions and it's"
4687760,4696640," going to be khr swap chain true uh and do you guys know the syntax do you guys know the syntax it's"
4696640,4704080," actually a very interesting syntax i think it's kind of like um uh updating the record in uh in haskell"
4704080,4714000," right so i think that creates like it takes the current record and then it creates a new instance of the record"
4714000,4721360," with certain things updated in there right so i think something like that uh so device extension"
4721360,4728960," and yeah so you use the default extension basically none of the extensions and like gs i didn't know"
4728960,4734000," how it is in gs but i think in gs is sort of like a spread operator right it's slightly different"
4736240,4742000," um all right so let's actually try to try try to experiment with that so it's going to be main rs"
4742000,4750640," let's imagine that you have foo right and in foo uh you have a bunch of things like uh bar which is"
4750640,4760800," u32 and uh something like buzz uh which is going to be absolutely why not so and let's create an entry"
4760800,4766720," function function i don't remember i think i think i have to do it like that and it would be nice to maybe"
4766720,4777200," derive yeah ah okay derive uh debug right just to be able to display this entire thing uh and let's"
4777200,4782800," do full where i'm going to initialize each individual thing so the bar is going to be equal to"
4783520,4791440," 69 and buzz is going to be equal to 420 of course so and let's try to print this entire thing right"
4791440,4795360," so it's going to be something like uh full"
4795360,4810240," uh and if i try to build rust c main dot rs more like okay i should stop uh okay so this is what we've"
4810240,4817360," got so and i suppose then you can define something like this where you say okay i want to define foo"
4817360,4827040," right where bar is going to be 23 but everything else is from foo you see what i'm talking about um"
4827040,4833280," so foo is going to be equal to that but bar is going to be equal to that so you create a new instance"
4833840,4840720," right where you modify only one single field but everything else is the same as in full all right"
4840720,4848640," and uh that should be all right yeah there we go so as you can see uh buzz is the same as in full and"
4848640,4853680," that's essentially what we're doing in here i think uh i think that's essentially what we're doing in"
4853680,4860880," here uh we're taking the device extensions where none of the extensions are enabled right and then"
4860880,4866880," we enable only one so we don't have to list all of the extensions because there's a lot of fields in"
4866880,4875840," device extension right there's a lot of booleans right so um yeah and i think spread i think spread"
4875840,4879520," kind of works a little bit different in there but maybe it is called spread"
4879520,4891520," it's just naming words are just words they're just labels uh anyway so yeah once we created that"
4891520,4897680," it's going to be triangle uh and after that what we need to do we need to create a device"
4898400,4904560," uh with the with the specific physical device and with the supported features and with particular"
4904560,4911360," extensions and with the specific queue right and the priority of that queue is going to be half but but"
4911360,4916560," i don't think priority matters that much because we have only one single queue i i suppose priority"
4916560,4924960," would matter if we had several of them right if we had only several of them um all right so a device"
4925520,4934080," uh let me actually go and see if this entire stuff compiles i'm going to do cargo cargo run and let's"
4934080,4941360," actually see um so we don't have device extensions so if i go in here uh it's going to be device"
4941360,4951520," extensions is part of the device uh it's a volcano device okay okay so use volcano device and uh we're"
4951520,4960880," gonna have something like device extensions um they call it struct update syntax because that's what it"
4960880,4968800," is it's a struct update uh it's basically similar idea as in in haskell right because in haskell a similar"
4968800,4976880," example would look like this uh just a second uh it's gonna be main uh by the world tv hello hello how are"
4976880,4988000," we're doing we're glad to see uh so yeah so you would have something like this uh data full so this one"
4988000,4995120," has to be haskell mod i suppose but it's not really in haskell mod for some reason okay uh white spades and"
4997600,5015840," uh full bar int uh and then buzz uh float uh deriving show right and the way you would update a fool right"
5015840,5026320," so we have a fool which is full uh bar equals 69 and buzz equal for 20 right and uh bar is going to be basically"
5026320,5032720," foo but you want to update specifically one thing in here so you essentially we're using it uh from"
5032720,5038720," here so it's more of a like a update of the particular record so i think this idea was taken"
5038720,5044160," from haskell but i i don't know uh maybe it was not taken from haskell because it's not that new of an"
5044160,5051040," idea i think ml languages like a camel also have a record update syntax it's essentially like a very"
5051040,5058720," functional idea of instead of mutating a structure you create a new structure based on the previous one"
5058720,5064560," so yeah it's it's a very pure functional thingy uh so yeah"
5067600,5071440," you know what i'm talking about um purely functional thingy"
5071440,5088320," all right so uh we have a device extension and uh can i print the device extensions just to see what's"
5088320,5098240," what's gonna be there device extension um uh help consider removing the"
5098240,5101280," borrow q"
5101280,5104560," okay"
5108480,5116080," okay i think in the triangle example they do borrow it don't they i swear to god they they do"
5116080,5123440," fucking borrow it uh no they don't okay i i don't know why i decided to put in here maybe my brain"
5123440,5131280," saw this pattern and somehow translated it uh to here so i'm not sure what exactly happened but yeah uh"
5133680,5136320," uh okay so let's actually save it in here"
5136320,5145520," um so and if i take a look at what happened now yeah we only have oh that's actually pretty cool it"
5145520,5151920," has a custom printer uh it has a custom printer so it only prints the extensions that are enabled"
5151920,5154960," okay that's that's pretty cool all right um"
5160800,5161840," so this is a triangle"
5161840,5174800," uh-huh so what i want you to do i want you to take a look at the device itself right so because we're"
5174800,5183840," calling to device and i need to get used to using only on this thing so uh and it also returns"
5184640,5191360," device not the physical one but a new like a logical devices i presume and queue situator"
5191360,5195760," all right so let's go ahead and do that let's go ahead and do that"
5195760,5205440," so device mutable cues uh device new and the things i provide i provide the physical device"
5205440,5214000," and then uh the features of the physical device i don't really understand uh why i have to provide"
5214000,5218960," these features like that but maybe yeah maybe i want to provide like a subset of the features"
5218960,5221680," not all of the physical features but sometimes a subset of them"
5222480,5230960," uh so yeah and then i have to provide device extension and the q family right and the"
5237840,5244320," this thing finally good music okay uh yep"
5244320,5253760," cool so and then i can rub this entire stuff so we managed to create device and queues hopefully"
5253760,5256480," right so let's see if this entire thing compiles"
5260400,5272080," so uh okay we also need to import the device then so i think this is where we have to do this device"
5272080,5276320," all right seems to be seems to be doing something"
5276320,5284880," seems to be doing something it takes so much time to compile everything i don't even know what exactly"
5284880,5291120," it's doing but yeah it's doing something definitely uh all right so what's gonna be the next thing uh"
5291120,5297920," yeah since we can request multiple cues the cues variable is in fact an iterator"
5297920,5306640," in this example we use only one cue so we just retrieve the first and only element of the iterator"
5306640,5313280," and throw it away okay that makes sense so uh that's the cue that we're gonna have in here so"
5314080,5320800," yeah and if i take a look at the queue so that should be it uh all right"
5320800,5327440," it's mining swap chain"
5327440,5340080," i see it's also mute access and stuff like that all right uh sure um okay the next one uh before we can"
5340080,5347040," draw on the surface we have to create what is called swap chain creating a swap chain allocates the color"
5347040,5353360," buffers that will contain the image that will uh ultimately be visible on the screen these images are"
5353360,5361840," returned alongside with the swap chain all right so this is like a huge section uh of creating a swap chain"
5362480,5368960," and the size of the section is 43 lines uh including different comments and whatnot and the result of"
5368960,5376320," these uh of this block is going to be a mutable swap chain and i suppose the frame buffers or images"
5376320,5386320," right yeah so these are color buffers uh so yeah that's that's pretty interesting um surface capabilities"
5391120,5400880," that's how we create a swap chain uh that's how we do that that's how we create a swap chain"
5400880,5408640," whatever that's supposed to mean uh i suppose yeah so essentially there is a notion of a double"
5408640,5415680," buffering in graphics in computer graphics right and essentially if you have two buffers you can swap"
5415680,5421280," between them right but you can have triple buffering right you can have a triple buffering and instead"
5421280,5426400," of swapping with them between them you essentially rotate between them and they form some sort of a"
5426400,5433120," chain and so to generalize this idea you can have a swap chain right so you can have a swap chain of two"
5433120,5440400," buffers maybe swap chain is three or four is my logic correct in here is that the logic behind the name"
5440400,5447200," swap chain so it's a generalization of double buffering on any amount of buffers do i understand"
5447200,5451600," that correctly do we have any professional vulcan developers and rust developers in the chat who"
5451600,5457680," worked at faeng and earn a lot of money every day do we have any of those people who can answer that"
5457680,5477040," question um so i don't know anyways all right so let's create a soap chain um let's create a soap chain"
5484640,5503520," okay swap chain images uh maybe right now i'm gonna just make it um a block because sometimes i want"
5503520,5510160," to just test some things so i take the surface and it queries capabilities right i query the surface"
5510160,5516080," capabilities based on the physical device all right so these are capabilities of the surface"
5516080,5522160," based on the physical device and here are my capabilities that i can try to print now hopefully"
5522160,5537920," so it's going to be caps uh all right so uh let me try to run this into i think"
5540160,5546560," a swap chain with two buffers is a double buffer seems about right okay all right so that that"
5546560,5555280," explains everything uh so we've got capabilities uh-huh all right that's cool uh so the next thing"
5555280,5560640," the alpha mode indicates how the alpha value of the final image will behave for example you can choose"
5560640,5568080," whether the window will be opaque or transparent all right to to have that i need to take the capabilities"
5568080,5579200," and uh supported composite alpha composite alpha iterate so i and then i just just use that"
5579200,5588720," uh all right so then i do alpha uh and there we go i have an alpha uh and if i try to print that"
5588720,5594000," what is it going to give me"
5594000,5610000," opaque cool um what if i iterate through all of these like uh capabilities right a composite alpha"
5610000,5618480," because it's an iterator right i'm kind of like curious what the what the is that like why why only why"
5618480,5624160," do we pick the first one and uh what are the rest of them what are the rest of them what are the rest of"
5624160,5638240," them i'm really curious what are the rest of them i wonder if there's too many of them oh so there's only"
5638240,5648240," two of them opaque and inherit interesting opaque and inherit all right so we're gonna pick the the first"
5648240,5655120," one uh so and we have to always pick the ones that are returned by supported ones we don't want to"
5655120,5661120," use the things that are not supported right so we have to be super careful with all that uh okay so"
5661120,5670560," choosing the internal format for the images we'll have uh so and we just pick the the first possible one"
5670560,5677440," and uh what's that uh what's that and the question is how many of the of these formats we have how many of"
5677440,5686080," these formats do we have uh let me see uh right of course we have to wait until it mines all the bitcoins"
5686080,5698080," so okay so this is the the format that we're going to use so we're going to use eight bytes for blue"
5698080,5704800," eight eight bit for blue eight bits for green a bit for red a uh and yeah this is this is the format that"
5704800,5712960," we're using here so cool uh but i wonder what other formats do we have what is even uh supported formats"
5712960,5718400," can we just print this entire thing like that and hope that it will give us maybe it's a vector or"
5718400,5736800," something else so let's find out okay so we actually have two of them two supported formats um rgb and norm"
5736800,5744240," um okay i guess it makes sense to pick the first one uh what's up being there sean hello hello how are"
5744240,5750800," doing uh okay so we're just picking the first one sure i'm okay with that um the dimension of the"
5750800,5756880," window only used to initially set up the swap chain note on some drivers the swap chain dimensions are"
5756880,5764720," specified by caps current extent and the swap chain size must use this extent these dimensions these"
5764720,5769440," dimensions are always the same as the window dimensions however all the drivers don't specify a"
5769440,5775920," value uh cup's current extent is none uh this just will allow anything but only sensible value in the"
5775920,5782160," window dimensions uh because for both of these cases the swap chain needs to be the window dimensions"
5782160,5792080," we just use that okay so i guess we just need to query the dimensions uh of the window just just in case"
5792080,5798240," uh just so we can initialize the swap chain so and it's going to be just array of two uh 32-bit numbers"
5800000,5807440," uh so we take the surface uh we take the surface we take the window and we take its inner size and"
5807440,5816240," we're converting it into uh an array of uh of these two numbers right so and i guess we um we gathered"
5816240,5823840," everything so please take a look at the docs uh for the meaning of the parameters we didn't mention okay so"
5824560,5829440," we are creating a swap chain now and there's a lot of parameters in here so are you guys ready"
5829440,5834800," are you guys ready so let's go and take a look at this thing swap chain"
5834800,5844240," uh so here's a swap chain contains this swapping system and the images that can be shown on the"
5844240,5849120," surface and here is the entire thing so you provide the device that will recreate it you provide the surface"
5849120,5856000," that we created with uh vulcan win and we in it so the amount of images that we want to create i suppose"
5856000,5864720," is going to be oh we're using minimal amount in minimal image count i presume that it could be actually"
5864720,5872240," two would it be let's actually check it out it's actually pretty cool idea to uh to try to to look"
5872240,5873600," into into those images"
5878480,5885040," uh all right all right so it's doing things it's doing things well it's compiling the source code"
5885040,5890480," and yeah it's two right so in our case it's going to be double buffering right so because it's caps and"
5890480,5899120," new image account equal to all right so uh format we know the format dimensions are the dimensions of the"
5899120,5906320," of the window layers uh layers layers layers we're gonna have one single layer i'm not sure what the"
5906320,5911840," the fuck is a layer though uh but i suppose maybe you can have several layers oh"
5911840,5921600," returns the number of layers of the image of the swap chain okay so a single image within the swap chain"
5921600,5928000," can also have several layers that's very interesting so within a single image you can just have multiple"
5928000,5935360," images i suppose uh and then we have image usage and image usage is what uh"
5935360,5943360," yeah i guess it's just like different parameters uh on how you use the image usage color attachment okay"
5943360,5946240," so then we provide the um"
5948960,5951440," my mouse has died actually believe it or not"
5951440,5960640," my mouse has died completely my second mouse that completely died unfortunately"
5960640,5964800," okay"
5970880,5976160," it's also color space okay i'm more or less understand what is going on more or less"
5976160,5991520," okay so let's actually go ahead and uh just copy paste this in there i think and"
5993120,5999760," just return the result of this entire stuff uh to be fair some of these things could be probably in"
5999760,6007360," lined uh but i'm not sure if it's too much uh so let me let me see if we can just do that okay so"
6007360,6011600," uh one of the things we didn't have a surface transform we didn't have a surface transform let's"
6011600,6023120," actually see if we have it here uh it's a vulcana swap chain surface transform okay uh use vulcana uh swap"
6023120,6032640," chain so we need to have that uh and of course i have to get a semicolon uh yes yes yes it's a present mod"
6032640,6037360," uh present mode something like this"
6039760,6043040," it's also part of the swap chain i'm gonna assume that everything is sort of"
6043040,6044080," part of the swap chain"
6044080,6052000," okay so present mode"
6068560,6074000," okay color space i'm not sure about the color space where cool space is located"
6074000,6095600," uh and swap chain itself uh is located in the soap chain of course"
6098560,6101520," image image image image usage color attachments"
6101520,6107280," uh so it's actually vulcana image okay"
6107280,6114080," uh use vulcana image image image usage"
6114080,6128480," uh okay so now i have to go back to my original triangle thingy original triangle thingy and just"
6128560,6135280," let's do something like this and what do we have in here uh i forgot a semicolon"
6135280,6142160," and i think finally it compiles i think we managed to create a swap chain"
6142160,6145120," i think we managed to create a swap chain"
6145120,6151680," okay maybe it would make sense to actually print the swap chain and see what is going on there"
6153680,6160320," uh swap chain there we go uh so let's wait it happen now you can just print that because it's not"
6161120,6185680," uh oh yeah okay okay will can swap chain"
6187680,6198640," we did it we did it we did it all right we now create a buffer that will store the shape of our"
6198640,6199440," triangle"
6202240,6208720," so um okay so yeah so this is a buffer cpu accessible buffer huh"
6208720,6221680," oh so you can define a vertex type and then mark it for the volcano to be a vertex type"
6221680,6228800," and it will treat it as a vertex type then later so you have to inform uh this library about this kind of"
6228800,6241440," thing okay uh makes sense uh it's kind of interesting that you have"
6241440,6254480," okay so that makes sense oh we have shaders yeah this is the coolest part here by the way so you can have"
6254480,6261120," shaders the compilation of which fails at compile time of the application right that's actually pretty cool"
6261120,6265920," that is actually pretty cool so they fail at compile time of the application"
6273840,6282240," okay okay uh maybe i want to make another cup of tea probably oh i want to make a small break because"
6282240,6287440," it's like really intensive like the amount of information and amount of stuff that you have"
6287440,6291120," to remember is just like really exhaustive does anyone have any questions maybe"
6294640,6300240," so i'm gonna just like chill a little bit because it's too much stuff"
6300240,6307840," how are you guys doing how are you guys doing do you guys program in vulcan uh professionally every"
6307840,6313840," day at your epic fang company using only rust and nothing else pushing the industry forward"
6314800,6334720," um yeah um working in crime yeah yeah it's pretty much the same for me too my company uses open gel but"
6334720,6340000," there are a few who keeps mentioning vulcan every day do they also mention uh rust every day too"
6340000,6348720," and the program individual c plus plus 2008 using direct x9 api that's"
6348720,6351360," that's the best kind of setup that you can have i think"
6355280,6363360," um but i got the triangle rendering with the writing my own bindings good good good uh i'm gonna write"
6363360,6370800," all of my c plus plus physics code to rust now nice finally is it safe programming inside vulcan yes"
6370800,6375360," it's not safe outside but inside is pretty safe"
6379360,6383280," not yet but i'm sure they will mention rust on the rhythm video article about that yeah"
6383280,6396400," so i'm a little bit hungry to be fair maybe i need to eat something so let's make a cup of tea maybe"
6407440,6413920," it's really funny how uh so many people were asking me zozin when you're gonna do vulcan and"
6413920,6418880," rust and all of this i'm doing vulcan and rust and everyone just realized how"
6418880,6425920," fucking complex and difficult that is and they will just bail down instantly like so there was like a 230"
6425920,6435280," people and uh oh it's oh okay um yeah all right so in the in the left it's just so funny like people just"
6435280,6440160," repeat shit on the internet that they hear on the internet without even realizing what they're"
6440160,6446160," repeating like so they don't even know what they're talking about i'm gonna upload this thing on the"
6446160,6452160," internet uh on on the youtube every time somebody's mentioning rust or vulcan it's just like go watch"
6452160,6458720," that word in its entirety i created it for you good luck"
6461520,6472400," uh so um"
6472400,6474400," hmm"
6474400,6480400," hmm"
6480400,6482400," hmm"
6482400,6484400," hmm"
6484400,6486400," hmm"
6486400,6499680," uh what's up combi combi hello hello all right"
6499680,6507280," what do we got what do we got uh so now we need to create a vertex buffer"
6507840,6509360," need to create a vertex buffer"
6509360,6513840," vertex buffer"
6513840,6525840," um construct vertex and is just a position that is of two values"
6525840,6536800," uh so uh then i can do vulcano uh implant vertex"
6537840,6541600," uh vertex position there we go"
6541600,6550320," so uh after that we have to use cpu accessible buffer i have no idea what is a cpu accessible buffer"
6550320,6557200," uh but i'm gonna try to search it here okay so here it is so this is a cpu accessible buffer"
6557760,6564240," uh buffer whose content is accessible by the cpu setting the host cached field blah blah blah blah blah"
6564240,6571120," blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah okay cool uh so uh it uses from iter if i can"
6571120,6580320," see it correctly from iter so we provide the device uh buffer usage whether it's host cached or not and so on"
6580320,6584480," and so forth all right so cpu accessible"
6584480,6589120," buffer uh from iter right so it's going to be device"
6589120,6594240," clone uh and then uh buffer usage"
6594240,6602080," all um so i want to take a look at the buffer usage what does it mean exactly precisely uh describe"
6602080,6606480," how a buffer is going to be used this is not just an optimization if you try to use buffer in a"
6606480,6612480," way that you didn't declare a panic will happen uh some methods are provided to build okay okay"
6612480,6618640," transfer source blah blah blah okay that's that's cool it's not an optimization it's just like uh"
6618640,6628480," you know permissions and one one uh so we're gonna have all and the other thing so um from iter"
6628480,6635440," host cached it's not going to be host cached in our case and the last thing we provide uh we provide the"
6635440,6640880," the data itself all right so but since it's an iterator so we have to con yeah we do convert it"
6640880,6648160," to an iterator so this is going to be our vertex but uh our triangle but their triangle is actually kind"
6648160,6655600," of dumb in my opinion so uh i rather prefer like minus five minus zero five minus zero five uh zero five"
6655600,6662080," minus zero five and uh zero zero five so we're going to use that triangle instead so this is going to be"
6662080,6670960," a position minus zero five uh minus zero five all right so uh let me actually do it like that uh the"
6670960,6676640," other one is going to be the positive one and the other one is going to be this one uh there we go"
6676640,6682480," something like this after that we're going to be converting all of that to an iterator"
6683440,6687840," and we're going to be cloning it for for whatever reason because it needs it needs to be cloned"
6687840,6699200," uh okay so uh so and after that i can just close this entire thing and then wrap it and that should be"
6699200,6709600," the result so can i just format like rust format i can only format the buffer okay and it it can't even"
6709600,6717120," format anything properly all right so um that's semicolon i think instead of semicolon here you"
6717120,6722800," have to have uh this thing can i format it now it looks like i can format it now cool cool cool all"
6722800,6726560," right so let's try to compile this entire thing and see if it's going to work or not uh it does not"
6726560,6732320," really work because why we don't have a cpu accessible buffer this is because it's located in"
6732320,6743360," here so it's a vulcana uh this thing um vulcana this thing and let me see so it's a buffer cpu access"
6743360,6750880," blah blah blah and let's try to recompile this entire stuff buffer usage is also not available uh i think"
6750880,6757840," i can find it here it's a vulcana buffer okay uh let's go here uh and i'm gonna do it like that um"
6759280,6765280," what was it was it buffer uh buffer usage yeah it's a buffer usage there we go"
6765280,6776240," uh buffer usage okay so what's what's the next thing uh so we'll kind of input in vertex okay um"
6776240,6781680," no function associated with the default something oh yeah we'll probably have to do it like that it's"
6781680,6791280," going to be uh derive default uh right so can we can have a default value uh all right so do we have"
6791280,6796400," any errors okay so i think uh we managed to compile that successfully i think we managed to compile that"
6796400,6809120," successfully okay so can i now uh try to print the vertex buffer i'm trying to print the vertex buffer"
6811840,6818560," okay it's not it's not printable attention uh main vertex cannot be formatted with oh yeah maybe"
6818560,6825680," because i have to like make it like a debug right so maybe then it will be formatted properly"
6836640,6847440," okay so here is the uh cpu accessible buffer and yeah we have all this um okay so what's gonna be the"
6847440,6852080," next thing so this is gonna be a triangle and we need to create the vertex shader the next step is to"
6852080,6858640," create the shader the raw shader creation api i provide provided by vulcan library is unsafe for various"
6858640,6865120," reasons and every of what the uh vulcan shader shader macro generates can be found blah blah blah whatever"
6865120,6870160," uh so we just need to create two shaders so this is going to be vertex shader and the vertex shader as"
6870160,6878080," far as you can see it just passes uh it just passes the position it receives from the vertex buffer to the"
6878080,6883920," fragment right it doesn't really modify it in any way um yeah it will be kind of interesting to maybe"
6883920,6890640," add some uniforms here like a time uniform and animate uh like rotate it around or do something"
6890640,6899680," with it or whatever uh and yeah and the fragment shader doesn't do anything except um except uh setting"
6899680,6908880," the color for the um uh for the triangle to red right so yeah it's pretty straightforward so i'm gonna go"
6908880,6914240," make a cup of tea uh so and we're gonna continue i think we are really close i do think we're really"
6914240,6921200," close we're already creating the shaders um then we need to create something called render pass whatever"
6921200,6928560," that's supposed to mean so then we have to create a pipeline uh so we have to create a dynamic state"
6928560,6936080," then we have to create a frame buffers um so we have a special variable for recreating swap chains maybe"
6936080,6942080," they could could be recreating during event loop um okay and then we're finally organizing the event loop"
6942080,6951280," and within the event loop uh we should be able to do all of this stuff and call shaders and whatnot and uh"
6951280,6958080," yeah so as you can see it's a very simple and straightforward api it's actually very simple and"
6958080,6964160," straightforward you just need to create all of these things and it should just work so yeah that's pretty"
6964160,6971840," cool i'm super excited about it uh but first first we need tea first we need tea uh so just a second uh yeah"
6974480,6985520," making cup of tea okay"
6985520,6994800," all right"
6994800,7006480," okay"
7006480,7008480," okay"
7008480,7008480," okay"
7024800,7046720," okay so um um um um all righty do you guys have any questions maybe"
7048080,7055200," do you guys enjoy uh the vulcan programming in rust i think it's pretty cool i think this is the future"
7055200,7061440," of software development i think everyone should jump on this vulcan rust uh train and rewrite all"
7061440,7068400," their applications in this beautiful technology to make it safe and more modern so i think i think it's"
7068400,7076080," amazing it's it's it is in fact absolutely amazing so i absolutely love it uh and the fact that it's so"
7076080,7082480," simple and accessible like anyone can just download this entire thing and start using it's just amazing"
7082480,7087840," like yeah it's it's all free it's all easy to grasp there's a lot of tutorials you can just learn all of"
7087840,7093600," that um it's just amazing it's it's absolutely amazing i think i absolutely love i absolutely love"
7093600,7111360," all of this technology um so yeah i'm just i'm just dead inside already so um"
7111360,7116720," i'm just waiting for me to see"
7119520,7128720," hmm"
7128720,7135200," it takes way too much time for some reason i don't quite don't quite understand why does it take so"
7135200,7140640," so much time"
7140640,7146480," swap chains"
7146480,7149520," so"
7149520,7154480," swap currencies"
7154480,7157200," oh"
7157200,7167520," oh shit i think it was me"
7167520,7169520," so"
7169520,7171520," so"
7171520,7177520," so"
7177520,7179520," so"
7179520,7181520," so"
7181520,7193840," just a second"
7193840,7206760," I'm back. Too bad."
7223840,7239620," Physical device."
7239620,7244500," So let's continue developing this shit. Let's continue developing."
7244500,7250520," So we stopped at creating VertexBuffer and we successfully created a VertexBuffer."
7250520,7254940," So the next thing is to create the shaders. Right. We need to create the shaders."
7254940,7259520," So they're creating the shaders in a separate module for some reason."
7259520,7263540," Probably because, yeah, probably this thing expands to a bunch of things."
7263540,7267900," That's why it's a separate module. Fair enough. Fair enough."
7267900,7274760," So let's put this. It's kind of cool that you can have nested modules within the functions."
7274760,7280500," So it's like a temporary module, but I mean, it's just like a namespace in this particular case."
7280500,7286080," So we'll kind of shaders, shader, and this is a macro that we're using."
7286080,7289500," So the type of the shader is going to be Vertex."
7289500,7298500," And source is this. All right. So yeah. Can I just put this thing like that?"
7298500,7302840," So the JLSL that we're using."
7302840,7306300," So I suppose the JLSL we're using is 450. All right."
7306300,7311500," And I suppose the support for that JLSL is provided more for by the JLSL compiler."
7311500,7319080," Right. Because as far as I know, in Vulkan, so the compilation of the shader happens before the execution of the program."
7319080,7325500," So there is a special JLSL compiler, which generates Sphere V or Sphere 5."
7325500,7330500," I don't know how to promote this thing with bytecode and you work directly with the bytecode rather than the source code."
7330500,7339500," So this entire thing should compile at the compile time of the application, unlike in older OpenJLSL."
7339500,7352500," Okay. So layout. Allocation 0. And this is going to be input for the position."
7352500,7363500," Okay. So void main. And we're not doing anything particular in this, but in this case, we're just passing the position to the fragment shader."
7363500,7372500," Right. So this is going to be position. Right. Here's position, deck 4, position. And there we go."
7372500,7377500," So that's the entire shader. Let's try to compile that and see if it compiles even."
7377500,7383500," It doesn't even compile because we don't have Vulkan shaders because it's probably some sort of crate."
7383500,7392500," And maybe this is the crate that we have to, yeah, we have to use it separately."
7392500,7398500," Yeah. Yeah. It's the latest shaders thingy."
7398500,7401500," So let me take a look at the crates.io."
7401500,7405500," So let's take a look at the crates.io. So let's go Vulkan shader."
7405500,7412500," The music is kind of annoying. So maybe I'm going to actually turn it off. Like, I'm sorry."
7412500,7418500," It's kind of difficult for me to focus on this kind of stuff while this music is playing all the time."
7418500,7424500," So let me take a look at Scargotomal. And so this is basically what we're going to have."
7424500,7430500," And I wonder how much time it will take to compile this thing from scratch."
7430500,7435500," Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. So downloading crates."
7435500,7438500," And yeah. So let's just have a cup of tea."
7438500,7444500," So we added another crate. And this is compilation time just to compile some shaders."
7444500,7448500," Oh, I remember this thing. I do fucking remember this thing."
7448500,7451500," This thing took me so much time to compile."
7457500,7460500," Oh, it also uses CMake. And yeah."
7460500,7462500," I can't fucking DMake."
7462500,7465500," Ah. All right."
7465500,7470500," Do you guys want to talk about anything? You guys... How are you guys doing?"
7470500,7485500," All right. Do you guys have anything to say? Like maybe some questions or anything else?"
7485500,7486500," How are you guys doing it?"
7486500,7488500," How are you guys doing it?"
7488500,7489500," Um..."
7489500,7493500," Monk to us."
7493500,7506500," So many questions that asking them will take over the stream."
7506500,7511500," I mean, we have nothing to do anyway. We're just waiting for this thing to compile. So feel free to ask them."
7511500,7512500," So..."
7512500,7513500," Do you have any questions?"
7513500,7514500," Shut, shut. Do you have any questions?"

7568500,7592820," Or you can also subscribe. So subscription grants you automatic trust everywhere. Is this really compiling right now? Yes, it is compiling right now, believe it or not. It's compiling the whole shader C system or something. What's Vulcan? It's a graphics API."
7594500,7613000," How are you enjoying Vulcan so far? Let's not talk about it. It's a species in a Star Trek. I never watched Star Trek, so I know nothing about it."
7620500,7640060," I never watched Star Trek either. Oh, okay. So, you lied. So, these are not species from the Star Trek."
7642160,7653860," That's actually a pretty interesting way of answering. Like, you can answer that to any question. What is X? And you can just say, it's just a creature from the Star Trek. Like, I never watched it, but I'm pretty sure it's a creature from the Star Trek."
7657160,7672160," So, it's a creature from the Star Trek. So, it's a creature from the Star Trek. Like, I'm pretty sure it's a creature from the Star Trek."
7672160,7677160," It's a creature from the Star Trek. It's a creature from the Star Trek. It's a creature from the Star Trek. It's a creature from the Star Trek. It's a creature from the Star Trek. It's a creature from the Star Trek. It's a creature from the Star Trek. It's a creature from the Star Trek. So, it's a creature from the Star Trek. It's a creature from the Star Trek. It's a creature from the Star Trek."
7677160,7687160," What's up? Sarimonosama. How are you doing? How are you doing? How's your Friday going? Hello, hello. We're compiling shaders again."
7687160,7701160," So far, we managed to create swap chain. We haven't got to the triangle yet. We haven't got to the triangle, but we managed to create swap chain."
7707160,7722160," We haven't got to the triangle yet. We haven't got to the triangle yet. We haven't got to the triangle yet. We haven't got to the triangle yet. It's a creature from the Star Trek."
7722160,7726160," Rust is great. I love rust. Cheers."
7726160,7738160," This really reminds me of Thomas the Tank engine song. I never watched Thomas the Tank."
7738160,7746160," Is that a creature from Star Trek? I'm sorry. I know what it is, but I really never watched it."
7746160,7751160," Because I think it was never a thing in Russia. Yeah, it was never a thing in Russia when I was a kid."
7751160,7769160," You do be rusting. Shaders do be rusting."
7769160,7774160," Is this reason everyone promote rust to have more time to waste? Yes, exactly."
7774160,7780160," Imagine deploying that at your work. How many coffee breaks you can make? It's insane."
7780160,7787160," Is it normal this takes too much to develop? Yes, it is normal."
7787160,7795160," And we haven't got into drawing a triangle yet. We haven't even created everything that is needed to draw a triangle."
7795160,7801160," We're not there yet, but we're still getting there, so don't worry about it."
7801160,7812160," So it is actually running something because you see compilation run. So if this status will become like finished or exit or fail or something."
7812160,7822160," It says run, so that means it keeps running. And these numbers are how many errors and warnings and infos were detected. It actually..."
7822160,7829160," We're still looking for running for running process."
7829160,7834160," To be fair, Stratrack has Android, so Thomas could exist on it. Yeah."
7834160,7836160," All right, so maybe I'm going to just do something like..."
7836160,7837160," All right, so maybe I'm going to just do something like..."
7837160,7838160," All right, so maybe I'm going to just do something like..."
7841160,7856160," ""Waiting for crates do be compiling""."
7856160,7860160," Okay, so this is what we're doing in here."
7860160,7866160," Oh, programming is a waste of time."
7866160,7869160," The entire programming industry is just to suck up money from people."
7869160,7873160," And their resources and their time and their lives..."
7873160,7876160," Like, this entire industry just sucks up everything."
7876160,7879160," It just sucks in general. That's what I can say."
7879160,7889160," ""You sure you aren't stuck in a compile time loop?"""
7889160,7890160," I don't think so."
7890160,7895160," I already compiled this specific package before the stream just to test things out."
7895160,7898160," And I know that this specific package does take so much time to compile."
7898160,7899160," So we just have to wait."
7899160,7901160," We just have to believe!"
7901160,7902160," Right."
7902160,7907160," The same way you have to believe in OOP and the same way you have to believe in NFP"
7907160,7910160," to improve the maintainability of your project."
7910160,7912160," You just have to follow the rules."
7912160,7915160," And your project will become so maintainable."
7915160,7917160," And if it doesn't become maintainable, it's your fault."
7917160,7920160," You just didn't follow the rules properly."
7920160,7921160," So, yeah."
7921160,7924160," You just didn't decompose your hierarchies well enough."
7924160,7925160," Right."
7925160,7926160," So, yeah."
7926160,7928160," We just have to believe."
7928160,7929160," We just have to believe in the same way."
7929160,7930160," We just have to believe in the same way."
7930160,7931160," We just have to believe in the same way."

7945160,7946160," We just have to believe in the same way."
7946160,7947160," What's up?"
7947160,7948160," What's up?"
7948160,7953160," Does anyone have any questions?"
7953160,7964160," Some interesting maybe on-topic questions."
7964160,7965160," What's up, Rolf?"
7965160,7967160," Hello, hello."
7967160,7975160," Hello, hello."
7975160,7977160," What color socks are you wearing?"
7977160,7979160," Why do you assume that I'm wearing socks?"
7979160,7993160," Nah, I can't show if it's because it's MongoTOS actually."
7993160,7996160," I think I heard people were getting banned for doing that."
7996160,8000160," So I'm not going to do that."
8000160,8001160," Is it right?"
8001160,8002160," Yeah, because of the fetish."
8002160,8006160," So it's considered like sort of kind of like a sexual content, to be fair."
8006160,8010160," Which is kind of strange, but I mean, I don't know."
8010160,8012160," I heard just rumors."
8012160,8013160," I don't know."
8013160,8014160," So I'd better not to risk it for the biscuit."
8014160,8015160," Okay."
8015160,8016160," Do you think Vulcan was created for corporations?"
8016160,8018160," I have no idea who it was created for."
8018160,8020160," I think it was created to torture people."
8020160,8021160," Can you show bananas?"
8021160,8021160," Can you show bananas on stream?"
8021160,8021160," Not on today's stream because I ran out of bananas."
8021160,8022160," I'm sorry."
8022160,8023160," But I showed bananas on my stream before and I even ate it on the stream and it was pretty"
8023160,8024160," delicious."
8024160,8025160," delicious."
8025160,8025160," No good."
8025160,8026160," No good."
8026160,8027160," No good."
8027160,8028160," No good."
8028160,8029160," No good."
8029160,8030160," No good."
8030160,8031160," No."
8031160,8032160," But yeah."
8032160,8033160," Writings to the clone is quite."
8033160,8045160," people can you show banana on stream not on today's stream because I ran out of bananas I'm sorry but"
8045160,8050200," I showed banana on my stream before and I even ate it on the stream and it was pretty delicious no good"
8050200,8063160," I don't know why but yeah writing to the clone is quite easy actually"
8075160,8090040," dosu supposed to be easier than OpenGL I haven't used either so I don't know hmm okay"
8104120,8109560," how do you like and how do you enjoy the Vulcan stream so far guys is it is it interesting is"
8109560,8113480," it educational have you learned something new do you guys think it's going to be the future of"
8113480,8121080," software development and computer graphics while we're waiting for the compilation um yeah share"
8121080,8128440," your opinion down below so I actually want to extend a bit so we can see the compilation running"
8133080,8147880," we're going to rust in place yeah"
8147880,8154680," to be fair I think Vulcano as a binding is a little bit too thick"
8154680,8161960," I think it's too too thick of a binding it could be a little bit thinner I could imagine the Vulcan experience"
8161960,8170680," in PRC being a little bit more comfortable than this um Vulcan seems to have too many dependencies for what"
8170680,8179240," it's doing like in an attempt to make safe bindings uh which is uh maybe maybe it's important for for some use"
8179240,8180040," cases I don't know"
8184520,8189480," whatever is causing whatever is causing that Intel massive thing seems to lock your compilation all the time"
8189480,8193240," how do you know that did you look into my computer and troubleshooted that or I don't know"
8193240,8207240," what makes seriesis uh so compile heavy I have no idea do I look like a Vulcan developer"
8208120,8216840," um do I um do I I don't know I'm using Vulcan for the first time in my entire life and I started"
8216840,8226840," with Rust by the way yes uh my first ever Vulcan experience is in Rust no joke so I've never did any Vulcan before"
8226840,8233560," um yeah I do have a degree in Rust"
8233560,8242520," can you run top yeah the top is it will just show you that uh all of the cores are uh are taken"
8242520,8248440," um I already compiled this thing before I know what is going on so we just need to wait you guys"
8249000,8254680," no no need to help me to troubleshoot the problem uh I already been there so I kind of know what's"
8254680,8259400," going on but what's funny is that during the stream I think it's going to take a little bit more time"
8259400,8266760," because I'm streaming so I don't have that many resources in my computer uh so yeah"
8276040,8278440," I wanted to say something but I forgot what I wanted to say"
8278440,8284120," uh oh yeah so degree in Rust"
8284120,8286920," ah whatever"
8286920,8293800," we're following the tutorial from Vulcan binding library yeah that's exactly what we're doing"
8293800,8304760," that's literally exactly what we're doing nothing else"
8304760,8308360," it seems like it's compiling C library yeah because shader C"
8308360,8314360," is the C library as far as I know is like a project for uh like by google for compiling shaders"
8314360,8319320," or something it's just for for Vulcan thinking and I think it's compiling this entire thing from scratch"
8320440,8320680," so"
8320680,8326360," nothing much to say just compiling this thing"
8326360,8332760," maybe you guys have any questions some interesting questions maybe"
8332760,8336680," while we're waiting for this thing to compile"
8347000,8354280," oh now I understand what you're talking about Vulcanization okay holy"
8354280,8365400," took me some time"
8365400,8374760," why nobody rewrites shader cc's you know exactly why nobody rewrites everything in Rust why are we still"
8374760,8385160," using these old as insecure languages everything has to be rewritten in Rust that's right"
8385160,8393960," um"
8393960,8402360," you see you see what i'm talking about you just have to believe"
8403720,8406120," you just have to believe and it's almost finished"
8406120,8414920," all of the non-believers mods mods ban all the doubters"
8414920,8418600," ban all the doubters and promote all of the believers"
8418600,8422120," um yeah okay as you can see it works"
8422120,8429800," so what we had to do we just had to wait a little bit we just had to wait and we finally compiled everything"
8432520,8440280," so um let me let me see so this entire stuff was needed just to compile this shader"
8440280,8446120," um as far as i know if you put a compilation error in here it will uh not compile because"
8446120,8449320," it tries to compile the shaders at compile time yes yes yes yes look at that"
8449320,8450280," uh"
8450280,8459160," and the error message is completely irrelevant nice i really like the fact that it only points here but it"
8459160,8467160," never tells you where within this entire thing the error has happened yeah cool thank you very much"
8467160,8476520," uh yeah so but it will be kind of cool if we had a macro right if we had a macro that also when it fails"
8476520,8484040," would tell you precisely in in this file where a thing has happened that is something i would really appreciate"
8484040,8493560," because but this is i don't know um okay so we have uh this thing so the next thing is going to be"
8493560,8498600," um fragment shader right next thing is going to be fragment shader"
8501560,8514520," so mod fs uh volcano shader shader and the type of the shader is going to be fragment and the source of the shader is going to be uh what"
8515240,8522760," so in the source of the shader we just do a very simple thing uh version 15"
8522760,8535160," uh layout location uh and the output vec4 f color right and one two three four uh what mean"
8536760,8540440," uh it's so convenient to use emix for this stuff"
8540440,8549000," color uh vec4 so we just set it to red right so we just set everything to red and let's try to"
8549000,8560680," recompile this entire thing and hope that it will in fact compile"
8560680,8568520," now keep the target folder like a treasure well"
8573480,8578280," oh"
8578280,8594440," all right so uh everything seems to be compound okay let's take a look at the triangle so after we"
8594440,8599080," compiled all of the shaders right after we compiled all the shaders we have to load all of them"
8600520,8608200," i see so interesting yeah so it generates a bunch of code within the module so we have to"
8608200,8617480," yeah we have to do it like that okay so i suppose i'm gonna do let vs i take vs module"
8617480,8625240," and i load that shader with the device i've no idea why i have to clone the devices all the time but i mean"
8625240,8630120," sure why not and the next thing i want to do i want to try to print that shader just to see"
8630120,8632280," if we manage to create it in any way"
8632280,8641560," and it seems doesn't seem to be very printable right because it's not debuggable okay fair enough"
8641560,8647000," uh for the fragment shader we're also going to have a fs and uh yeah i guess that's going to be"
8647000,8653720," all right so we're going to be loading all the shaders what the hell is shader shader is a program"
8653720,8659800," that runs on your gpu so there are programs that runs on your cpu and the problems that"
8659800,8664920," execute on your gpu we usually call shaders it's a rough idea not not precisely but"
8664920,8666920," it's a good approximation"
8666920,8677720," okay at this point opengl initialization would be finished however in vulcan it is not"
8677720,8685320," opengl implicitly does a lot of computation whenever you draw in vulcan you have to do all this manually"
8685960,8692920," the next step is to create a render pass which is an object that describes where the output of the"
8692920,8700040," graphics pipeline will go it describes the layout of the images where the colors depth and slash or"
8700040,8706200," stencil information will be written do you guys know what is a stencil buffer you guys know what is a stencil"
8706200,8717320," buffer um so stencil buffer is almost like a z buffer right if if i understand correctly i've never actually"
8717320,8723560," used a stencil buffer but it's almost like a z buffer and i already explained what is it what is a z buffer"
8723560,8729400," right so essentially you have a color buffer which is image of the pixels that you're displaying but"
8730040,8738280," with each pixel you can associate the z value of that pixel right and as you associate the z value of"
8738280,8745960," that pixel uh when you draw more polygons on your image uh you can compare the z values and some of the"
8745960,8752520," pixels can be removed completely because they are behind other pixels right so it's a z value on the level of"
8752520,8758840," each unusual pixel and that way um in 3d graphics application you can see two polygons actually"
8758840,8766760," penetrating each other uh quite like quite nicely because uh because there's a z buffer that uh basically"
8766760,8773720," cuts off uh parts of the planes and stuff like that stencil as far as i know if i'm not sure if i"
8773720,8777160," pronounce the character but i think this is how it's pronounced uh how this word is supposed to be"
8777160,8785720," pronounced is it's a generalization of that idea so what if we not going to have only z but any kind"
8785720,8790760," of values right so maybe it's not going to be z maybe it's going to be something else whatever you want"
8790760,8799800," and uh the pixels are going to be cut off not when z is bigger or smaller than another z but by your own"
8799800,8805880," rules what if you define the rules when this sort of pixels could be cut off right so and that's what"
8805880,8811480," the stencil so basically it's your own customizable z buffer but not not only for z but for anything"
8811480,8817000," right and that way uh one of the i guess one of the classical examples of using the stencil buffer is"
8817000,8828680," when you're um create a reflection right so i think uh stencil buffer reflection right uh planner reflection"
8828680,8832840," uses stencil buffer yeah there is a pretty good example that that shows that um"
8835000,8841800," yeah essentially look you have a scene you render the same scene on the other side of the mirror"
8841800,8849880," and then with the stencil you cut off everything that is outside of the mirror you see so this is"
8849880,8855320," not z but it's something else but it also uses the same mechanism of values on the level of pixels to"
8855320,8861320," actually cut off some of the pixels right so yeah that's basically what is a stencil and how it's used"
8861960,8872120," um yeah that's basically what it is um does it make sense it makes sense um all right"
8872120,8882200," as well for individual pixels a pixel buffer if you will yeah like an alpha mask sort of but not only"
8882200,8888840," alpha you can customize the behavior alpha is a very specific thing right so it's specifically transparency"
8888840,8893640," but you can use it for whatever you want and with whatever rules you want right so it's like a more"
8893640,8897480," general version of all of that um okay"
8897480,8903400," so we need to create something that is called uh render pass"
8908040,8917160," so we need to make sure that our render passes uh that's for sure um so how can i even start all"
8917160,8920360," this so single pass render pass um"
8920360,8932840," and we also have to do that inside of arc and that arc is gonna be okay so let's just go and implement that"
8934840,8942920," let's render pass uh arc arc new new and this entire thing doesn't have to be abrupt okay"
8942920,8950840," so we're gonna put the semicolon here and vulcana uh single pass render pass"
8950840,8954520," okay"
8958680,8966440," after this stream i'm definitely trying vulcan in prc i'm 100 percent trying vulcan in prc seriously"
8966440,8970200," because it's kind of interesting i think in prc is going to be a little bit easier to work with"
8970200,8977560," um a little bit not too much but maybe a little bit so we're gonna have that then we're gonna have"
8977560,8984680," attachments uh color is a custom name we give to the first and only attachment so we have a color"
8985400,8990360," a lot clear um i have no idea what is going on in here"
8990360,8995240," i i can't i don't even know what to start from like where"
8995240,9010200," okay so am i at the the right place i think so this is this single pass render pass"
9011400,9018920," builds render pass object whose uh whose template parameter is of in term indetermined type"
9018920,9026680," um all right so so we have to do attachment and okay"
9026680,9036280," i love rust it's so straightforward and easy to understand i absolutely love it it's just so good"
9037560,9045560," all right so we have attachment and have a pass uh how does rust it feels absolutely amazing everyone"
9045560,9054520," should use this language and everyone should ditch c and open gl use only rust and vulcan trust me"
9054520,9061720," this will change your life forever seriously stop stop using all of these old ass technologies"
9062360,9077960," use the rust it will save your life uh okay so this is a store and we use the format swap swap chain format"
9079560,9087960," uh samples one do we have anything else uh i don't think we have anything else so then uh we use the color"
9087960,9096200," color and depth stencil is this thing okay so we did the thing um"
9098840,9109000," i honestly think you just have an issue with what are you talking about i don't have a single where do"
9109000,9117000," you see a single issue so far on today's stream what are you talking about everything compiles so far"
9117000,9118840," everything works"
9121320,9124200," excuse me what the hell are you talking about"
9124200,9130840," uh maybe you have issues i don't know i don't have any issues everything works perfectly what the hell"
9130840,9135480," are you talking about all right so uh render pass"
9135480,9146760," and yeah let me see okay so um not found in this particular case so what we need to do here we just need"
9146760,9155720," to import the arc right we just need to uh input the arc uh and i think it's nstd sync okay so the example"
9155720,9163080," itself is probably imports it from like our yeah so we use it from a sync okay uh let's put it here"
9163080,9165400," looks okay"
9165400,9174680," let's recompile these tools okay cannot be formatted using i mean okay at least it created something at"
9174680,9180920," least it created something which i'm super happy about"
9180920,9198680," honk honk okay so uh let me see everything seems to be compatible okay cool"
9200920,9210440," uh triangle um render pass so we created a single render pass before we draw we have to create what"
9210440,9219320," is called a pipeline this is similar to an open gl program uh but much more specific uh-huh"
9220840,9225400," open gl program but much more specific okay that's interesting"
9225400,9241720," so graphics pipeline uh so we need to indicate the layout of the vertices input single buffer so then"
9241720,9247560," the vertex shader then the triangle list viewport dynamic scissors relevance okay"
9248440,9256040," um so there's also dynamic state in here okay so graphics pipeline so let me see what is the graphics"
9256040,9263400," oh this is a wrong place to to look for for this kind of stuff graphics pipeline so it's available in"
9263400,9267800," okay okay okay okay uh this is a triangle"
9267800,9277800," do i already have pipeline yeah i don't"
9277800,9291880," pipeline uh graphics pipeline there we go and uh in here graphics pipeline i'm just starting the pipeline i'm not"
9291880,9294520," quite sure that why they're not quite sure that why they're wrapping everything in"
9294520,9301400," arcs is it really necessary it feels like it's really necessary for this specific example but"
9301400,9307480," i mean it is what it is maybe when you're passing them to somewhere it could be necessary"
9307480,9313000," all right so it's going to be arc new"
9316840,9325560," graphics start and um so um so vertex input single type uh okay so this is the first thing we have in"
9325560,9333240," here uh then we're using the vertex shader oh interesting so the main entry point"
9335640,9340360," ah huh huh that's pretty cool all right"
9340360,9353320," try this the content of the vertex buffer describes a list of triangles okay that makes sense uh that"
9353320,9359480," makes sense so far view for dynamics is irrelevant uh use a resizable viewport set to draw over the entire"
9359480,9367720," uh window sure uh fragment shaders see fragment shader we have to indicate that's interesting so"
9367720,9376520," oh are are these like different phases of the pipeline that's actually a pretty interesting way of doing that"
9377080,9386520," uh huh huh okay uh so render paths and we're even cloning this entire thing"
9386520,9394520," okay so then we're building it with the device uh building it with the device"
9395320,9402280," and then we're unwrapping this entire thing uh and finally we have everything we're going to have in"
9402280,9408920," our entire life and i'm pretty sure pipeline is not printable right so you can just print pipeline and"
9408920,9415800," make sure that it's working uh sub pass we don't have a sub pass where sub pass is available sub pass"
9416760,9425880," uh so it is available in a frame buffer so let me let me quickly grab that so this is where it is"
9425880,9436600," available i wish my mouse was a little bit more like this a little bit more like this there we go"
9441320,9452360," okay so what do we have in here uh given pipeline consider i don't type in a station needed i've no idea"
9452360,9459480," cannot infer type v okay"
9459480,9470360," um how does it work in here then i guess it works in there because we use pipelines somewhere down below but"
9471080,9477720," apart from that i don't see like why it wouldn't compile properly but it does that's compile i suppose"
9477720,9485480," maybe i'm gonna just uh you know comment out pipeline because right now it cannot infer the type of pipeline"
9485480,9499640," all right"
9500840,9508520," cool so then triangle so then we need to create a dynamic state dynamic viewports allow us to recreate"
9508520,9514520," just the viewport when the window resized otherwise we would have to recreate the whole pipeline"
9514520,9523640," okay makes sense i guess uh dynamic state is available in vulcano command buffer state so"
9523640,9532520," so we have to import this thing from here uh yes so i'm going to just put it in here so now we have a dynamic state"
9532520,9536520," so it's going to be a dynamic state"
9536520,9543320," and this is the dynamic state that we have so filled with a bunch of nones"
9543320,9551080," nones uh all right so can i now print it to indicate that it's actually the thing that i think it is"
9551080,9558440," i'm a little bit hungry not gonna lie um okay so i forgot to put a semicolon in there"
9559000,9571880," i think that's what i forgot to do this isn't a convention uh why is it filled with nones"
9579480,9591320," okay so let's continue uh windows side dependent setup oh okay i think yeah so they extracted this"
9591320,9596680," shed into a separate function this method is called once during initialization then again whenever the"
9596680,9603800," window is resized yeah yeah so we need to resize the window here we accept uh images which is swap chain"
9603800,9610280," images for the window render pass and dynamic state and i guess we're just updating the viewport you know"
9610280,9618520," how in opengl you just do gl viewport um so in here you have to do this kind of stuff explicitly"
9618520,9627000," and also returns you a bunch of frame buffers and whatnot but yeah so uh let me see so it's a window"
9627000,9632920," resize uh so you just take the frame buffers and every time something resized we we have to"
9632920,9638760," recall this entire thing okay um so you know what i want to want to do i want to make a small break i"
9638760,9648040," wanna uh pee so rust makes me wanna wanna pee really really badly you guys want to listen to some music"
9648040,9659800," what music do you guys want to listen to uh how about some country cake code um hey bro uh okay so let me see"
9662040,9669560," uh is it is it playing"
9669560,9673800," doesn't sound very country to me"
9673800,9689560," all right let's make some break and you guys have fun"
9691160,9721140," Thank you."
9721160,9751140," Thank you."
9751160,9781140," Thank you."
9781160,9811140," Thank you."
9811160,9837160," Thank you."
9837160,9839100," Yo, what's up, everyone?"
9839100,9841240," How everyone is doing?"
9841240,9845040," I'm back to get..."
9845040,9851000," So, let me see."
9851300,9859880," So, we need this function, which basically is called when the window is resized."
9859880,9863540," So, window size depend setup."
9864080,9867640," And in here we accept images, right?"
9867640,9874420," So, which is a slice of arcs of swap chain images for a specific window."
9874420,9877520," I guess that's what it means, right?"
9877520,9884380," It's a slice of arcs of swap images, swap chain images for a specific window."
9884600,9891540," And arcs is basically reference counter, right?"
9891540,9892780," So, reference counter."
9892780,9895740," All right."
9895740,9897980," So, and then we're going to accept the render pass."
9897980,9903780," Arc render pass."
9904220,9906220," You know, it feels really strange."
9906220,9909020," Like, is arc really, really needed in here?"
9909020,9913160," Like, we're not doing anything super sophisticated."
9913160,9915360," Like, I don't know."
9915360,9916380," It's really neat."
9916380,9921240," Dynamic state, mute, dynamic state."
9921440,9925920," So, maybe the next thing, once I make it work, if I ever make it work on today's stream,"
9925920,9929180," because we're already finishing the third hour of the stream."
9929180,9934900," We're almost finished the third hour of the stream, and we don't have anything on the screen yet."
9934900,9939260," So, if I ever finish, I'm going to try to get rid of the arcs."
9939260,9944540," But maybe arcs are needed, because the library itself accepts a lot of arcs."
9944540,9947900," So, but so far it feels like, I'm not sure if it's really needed."
9947900,9950320," Like, arcs, are they really needed here?"
9951440,9953000," But yeah, so it's going to be arc."
9953000,9956780," Frame buffer abstract."
9956780,9959280," Frame buffer ups."
9959280,9964840," That's not fragment, but it's a frame buffer abstract."
9964840,9968720," So, and also it implements send and sync."
9968720,9971200," So, this is the thing that has to be implemented in here."
9971200,9974900," And can I in here return just whatever?"
9974900,9978320," So, can I return vec empty?"
9978900,9982220," Just to see is if it's compiled or not."
9982220,9983740," Vulcana is weird."
9983740,9984800," Yeah, I already noticed."
9984800,9987100," I already noticed that it's a little bit weird."
9987100,9989340," So, we don't have a swap chain image."
9989340,9994360," So, it is available in Vulcana here."
9994580,9999440," So, if I do something like this, can I then select this entire thing?"
9999440,10000840," I'm not using any mouse, by the way."
10000840,10003860," So, that's actually pretty cool."
10003860,10007660," I just copy pasted this entire stuff without using any mouse."
10007660,10009520," That's cool."
10010340,10015820," Because technically, right, you can do something like swap chain, right?"
10015820,10019820," And then press shift and right and continue selecting."
10019820,10023600," And then you can press ctrl c and just copy this text."
10023600,10027740," And that is without using any special plugins for the browser."
10029320,10032980," Who needs mouse, anyway?"
10032980,10034320," You know what I'm talking about?"
10034320,10036600," All right."
10036600,10041740," Creep paste degree."
10041740,10042340," Yes."
10042340,10044460," So, does it compile?"
10044460,10045460," No."
10045460,10046980," Should we compile now?"
10049540,10053140," So, window, we don't have a window."
10053140,10056920," So, maybe I have to do something like this."
10056920,10060400," But the window could be, yeah."
10060400,10066760," The value of window might be coming from here."
10066760,10074400," And look, I'm selecting this entire thing like that."
10074400,10075760," Boom."
10075760,10077380," And I can just go here."
10078260,10081580," And just, boom."
10081580,10084620," Who needs mouse?"
10084620,10087080," My gut."
10087080,10091100," I'm a copy paste master."
10091100,10097080," I copy paste from Stack Overflow so many times."
10097080,10099620," I didn't even need a mouse for that anymore."
10099620,10101360," That's how many times I did that."
10101360,10102880," That's absolutely epic."
10107380,10109560," So, we don't have a render pass for some reason."
10109560,10112460," Which is really interesting."
10112460,10113520," Render pass."
10113520,10115620," Do we have a render pass?"
10115620,10117080," I think we do have it."
10117080,10119600," Volcano."
10119600,10121540," Can I?"
10121540,10123360," I can actually select by words."
10123360,10130380," Because if you press shift control and left and right, you can select and unselect by words like that."
10130460,10133980," Which actually speeds up your selection strategy."
10133980,10135620," So, yeah."
10135620,10137240," Just a second."
10137240,10139380," And then boom, boom, boom, boom."
10139380,10140900," And then you copy paste it."
10140900,10141880," And, yeah."
10141880,10145860," So, you can actually improve your stats on copy pasting quite easily."
10146220,10147360," So, the frame buffer."
10147360,10149060," We already have a frame buffer in there."
10149060,10152240," So, I can probably put this thing somewhere here."
10152240,10153080," Right."
10153080,10154380," So, something like that."
10154380,10155020," And there we go."
10155020,10158620," Absolutely goddamn fucking amazing, mate."
10158620,10160080," Holy shit."
10160080,10162340," Frame buffer abstract."
10162340,10163360," What about this one?"
10164720,10165520," And there we go."
10165520,10167320," So, it's going to be Volcano."
10167320,10169580," Volcano."
10169580,10171100," And boom, boom, boom."
10171100,10177540," And to be fair, I'm pretty sure we already have frame buffer in here."
10177540,10177900," Right."
10177900,10180080," So, that means I can just put this entire thing in here."
10180080,10181620," And there we go."
10181620,10182760," So, that should compile."
10182760,10183540," Fuck."
10183540,10184340," It didn't compile."
10184340,10187960," Excuse me."
10187960,10192580," So, render pass."
10192580,10195560," It doesn't like my render pass situation for some reason."
10195560,10199000," So, if I take a look at that."
10199000,10200700," So, it has a render pass."
10200700,10203180," Right."
10203180,10207140," But when I try to compile this entire thing, it complains that it's expected one type argument."
10207140,10211240," Maybe it's expected for this render pass."
10211240,10212280," Let me see."
10212280,10215120," Render pass is from render pass."
10215120,10217740," But in here, render pass."
10217740,10219000," Oh, I see."
10219000,10219620," I see."
10219620,10220040," I see."
10220040,10223300," So, it is, in fact, from render pass."
10223300,10225660," Render pass."
10225660,10227220," Yeah."
10227220,10228660," Okay."
10228660,10230460," So, maybe I have to do it like that."
10230460,10231740," Oh, shit."
10231740,10234180," And all these things are from different places."
10234180,10234520," Okay."
10234520,10235840," Okay."
10235840,10236160," Okay."
10236160,10237520," All of them are from different places."
10237660,10243520," So, apparently Vulcana has several packages that contain types with the same name."
10243520,10251900," And all of that is within the single library."
10251900,10255080," But maybe it has something to do with Vulcan specifically."
10255080,10260240," Maybe Vulcan just forces you to have the same names in different packages."
10260240,10267840," So, maybe there is a frame buffer as a concept on its own and frame buffer as a concept in the context of render pass."
10267840,10271240," You know, it do be like that sometimes."
10271240,10274200," So, software development."
10274200,10275060," Naming is hard."
10275060,10275420," Okay."
10275420,10277340," We all know that naming is hard."
10278340,10279560," So, yeah."
10279560,10282700," Let's continue."
10282700,10284160," So, maybe it will compile."
10284160,10287740," I could not find render pass in Vulcana."
10287740,10289620," Oh, no."
10289620,10292500," Oh, no."
10292500,10297520," Oh, no."
10298680,10300760," Is that a separate package?"
10300760,10309480," Okay."
10309480,10310760," So, it's probably a separate package."
10310760,10312080," Let's try to find out."
10312080,10313800," Render."
10313800,10316320," So, we have a Vulcana shaders."
10316320,10319820," No."
10319820,10324240," That's pretty strange."
10328660,10340600," So, I think I already import everything that is needed in here."
10340600,10341820," So, I don't think so."
10341820,10349300," Could it be that the version differs in here?"
10349300,10352380," Could it be that the version differs?"
10352380,10354900," It could be the case, actually."
10354900,10357700," It could be actually the case."
10358660,10360940," Because there, they're using their own thing."
10360940,10366120," But, in my case, render pass."
10366120,10368100," And what does it say?"
10368100,10372060," It says that could not find render pass in Vulcana."
10372060,10375060," And used to import graphics parts."
10380060,10381860," So, let me go there."
10381860,10385360," So, maybe it's not in Vulcana."
10385360,10388640," So, it says the SRC."
10388640,10391180," Yeah, here's the render pass."
10391180,10392140," Here it is."
10392140,10394420," Here it focuses."
10394420,10397940," But now, let's try to do the following thing."
10397940,10401260," I'm going to go to the release tags."
10401960,10403780," So, this is the release that we're using."
10403780,10404800," Right."
10404800,10406340," This is the release that we're using."
10406340,10409600," And in here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10409600,10411700," And then to here."
10411700,10414060," And do I have a render pass?"
10414060,10416300," No, I didn't have a render pass."
10418800,10422540," And I'm using the latest Stable Vulcana."
10422540,10425360," And the examples in the master."
10425360,10427340," Examples in the master."
10427340,10429900," Depending on the features that are not released yet."
10430800,10444580," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10444580,10446480," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10446480,10447580," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10447580,10449280," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10449280,10451540," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10451540,10453680," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10453680,10455340," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10455340,10457660," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10457660,10459420," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10459420,10459900," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10459900,10460700," And then to here, I'm going to go to the Vulcana."
10460700,10464100," Okay."
10464100,10468780," If I understand correctly, of course."
10468780,10472680," So I'm going to go to version 0.22, the one that I'm using."
10472680,10476700," And I'm going to go into the examples."
10476700,10480340," And let's find a triangle there."
10480340,10483080," And hopefully, it does have a triangle in there."
10483080,10483780," Right."
10483780,10487060," And if you take a look carefully, render pass."
10487060,10489080," Okay."
10489240,10492440," So it doesn't import anything from the render pass."
10494440,10506740," Oh, and in here, instead of depending on the type called render pass, it depends on interface called render pass abstract, plus send, plus sync, and so on and so forth."
10508180,10508800," You see?"
10508800,10511180," So, okay."
10511180,10514400," So, yeah, this is actually pretty cool."
10516260,10516700," Yeah."
10516700,10516720," Yeah."
10516720,10519020," So, the example still exists."
10519020,10524020," It's just like for the version of Vulcana that I'm using, it has to be slightly different."
10524420,10531540," So, the thing is, I'm not really sure how many changes they introduced into the new example."
10531540,10538100," So, the thing I'm going to do now, I'm going to grab this thing and put it on my hard drive."
10538440,10539560," I'm going to just download it."
10539560,10543800," And then, I'm going to download the version from the master and make a div between them."
10543800,10550780," And I'm going to make sure that there didn't introduce something like very, very special and didn't rewrite the example completely."
10550780,10555780," I just want to see that the differences are in the render pass situation so far."
10556140,10558220," So, it's not the end of the world, as you can see."
10558220,10559140," So, it's not the end of the world."
10559140,10562920," We actually caught it pretty early on, which is quite cool."
10562920,10565300," I'm a little bit tired already, but I mean, yeah."
10565300,10568320," Okay."
10568320,10570240," So, here is the stuff."
10570240,10572840," So, I'm going to just try to download this entire thing."
10572840,10575800," It's going to be wget."
10575800,10584700," And I'm going to save it to triangle v0220rs."
10586140,10588740," So, here is that."
10588740,10593220," I think I made accidentally a couple of changes to this example from the master."
10593220,10595780," So, I'm going to actually re-download the master example."
10595780,10600380," So, let me see how I can do that."
10600380,10605980," So, in here, I think you can just replace this entire stuff with the master."
10605980,10607360," Right."
10607360,10609800," And I'm going to have the master example."
10609800,10610820," The master example."
10610820,10612240," Then, I'm going to take it to raw."
10612240,10613160," Got you, hyper."
10613160,10614880," I'm taking it raw."
10615580,10616620," So, let me double check."
10616620,10617200," Yes."
10617200,10619140," It is a master, in fact."
10619140,10621140," Okay."
10621140,10624240," And I'm going to just do it like that."
10624240,10626280," It can be O."
10626280,10629460," Triangle master."
10629460,10634840," Who needs dungeon master when you have a triangle master?"
10634840,10637180," My name is Van."
10637180,10638320," I'm a master."
10640860,10641760," I'm an artist."
10641760,10642780," I'm a performance artist."
10642780,10644480," All right."
10644480,10648020," Anyway, I think I'm getting sidetracked."
10648020,10649440," I think I'm getting sidetracked."
10649440,10656980," So, I'm going to do div u starting from the previous version and to the master one."
10657240,10661560," And let's actually save it to the file."
10661560,10663140," Because then I can."
10663140,10674100," Okay."
10674100,10676600," Do I want to open it?"
10676600,10678200," Do I want to disappoint myself?"
10679200,10679600," Okay."
10679600,10680600," Oh, okay."
10680600,10682240," So, it's just like, it's not that much."
10682240,10683860," Actually."
10683860,10685320," All right."
10685320,10689180," The only changes that they made are to the render pass."
10689180,10691240," This is literally the only changes."
10693240,10694100," Very nice."
10694100,10696360," Very, very nice."
10696360,10697960," Oh, and yeah."
10697960,10700480," All of these things were before."
10700480,10701300," Okay."
10701300,10708800," Remember how I said there was a situation that they have the same types in different sub packages?"
10708800,10710480," Well, that was not the case."
10710480,10715760," They just moved them in a new release to a different sub package or module."
10715760,10717500," So, that's what happened."
10717500,10720160," That's why, in example, I saw them in one package."
10720160,10722280," But they were moved in another one."
10722280,10726620," So, since we're using an older version, we're not using even that old of a version."
10726620,10729780," We're using the one that is the latest stable."
10729780,10731340," This is not the release changes."
10731340,10732360," Right."
10732360,10736520," Since we're using the older version, we have to just use that one."
10736520,10738160," Oh, boy."
10738160,10738600," Okay."
10738600,10743960," I'm really glad that we caught that early on and it didn't go too much into like a rabbit hole."
10743960,10746840," And the rabbit hole stopped around like right here."
10746840,10748620," So, yeah."
10748620,10749240," Okay."
10749240,10752200," I think I need to make a cup of tea."
10752280,10754340," So, before I'm going to go."
10754340,10754620," Yeah."
10754620,10756960," So, it's just like this is the only changes that we have to make."
10756960,10758560," I'm super happy."
10761500,10761940," All right."
10761940,10763520," Does anyone have any questions?"
10763520,10765580," Does anyone have any questions?"
10765580,10772360," Valentin, what's up?"
10772360,10772880," How are you doing?"
10772880,10774240," How are you doing?"
10774240,10775840," Welcome, welcome, welcome."
10775840,10780600," Thrash5, what's up as well?"
10780600,10783000," Did you exercise today?"
10785000,10791580," I'm a little bit tired already."
10791580,10793180," So, I'm streaming for three hours."
10793180,10793580," I'm a little bit tired already."
10793580,10797320," So, I'm streaming for three hours."
10797320,10810840," I'm making a cup of tea."
10810840,10814620," Yes, yes, yes."
10814620,10815420," A cup of tea."
10815420,10817020," All right."
10817020,10818480," So, it's going to be super quick."
10818540,10821680," I'm going to go to the kitchen and turn on the kettle and I'm going to be back."
10821680,10827840," So, if you have any questions, prepare them and maybe I'm going to answer them."
10827840,10830020," All right."
10830020,10831580," Mm-mm-mm."
10860020,10887400," I really took two attempts on getting into Vulcan, but both times I couldn't handle it because"
10887400,10893440," of how tedious it was and because I didn't have any real application."
10893440,10898960," Well, I'm just following the tutorials, I'm not even doing anything special, so yeah, we'll"
10898960,10899960," see how it goes."
10899960,10905280," So I just ended up drawing some basic stuff and moved on with my boring PHP life."
10905280,10907500," You may want to start with OpenGL, actually."
10907500,10912500," OpenGL is a little bit simpler in that regard, and I would probably even recommend for people"
10912500,10921000," to start with OpenGL, because in OpenGL, you can at least learn some of the concepts that"
10921000,10924540," could be useful in Vulcan, right?"
10924540,10928960," Because for example, I know a little bit of OpenGL and I started to use Vulcan and I'm like,"
10928960,10933960," oh, okay, so I know some of these concepts already, even though I don't know Vulcan."
10933960,10938000," So, and knowing OpenGL definitely helped and it's just like, yeah."
10938000,10947040," I don't know, I don't know."
10947040,10949040," Does anyone have any questions?"
10949040,10950040," Maybe."
10950040,10953040," I'm just waiting for my kettle to..."
10953040,10964140," Okay, so main or ass."
10964140,10966080," More like main my ass."
10966080,10967080," Ah!"
10967080,10968240," Frame buffer."
10968240,10971100," So this has to be a frame buffer."
10971100,10976760," And instead of this thing, we just have to put this thing in there."
10976760,10990240," Vulcan is a safe wrap around Vulcan, yes, it is true."
10990240,10991480," You can Google that."
10991480,10996260," It's actually the first thing that pops up when you Google ""Rust Vulcan"", and that's literally"
10996260,10998300," the only reason why I chose it."
10998300,11003100," because I was thinking, ""I think the time has come to stream Rust and Vulcan"", and I just"
11003100,11009960," Googled ""Rust Vulcan"", and this was the first link, and this is how we got here."
11009960,11012400," So, not so much to say."
11012400,11014920," This is how I make all of my technical decisions."
11014920,11017920," Wait, wait, wait, wait."
11017920,11040680," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
11040680,11064760," People keep talking about something called ""Ash"", but ""Rust Vulcan""."
11064760,11069300," Do you see ""Ash"" anywhere in here?"
11069300,11071300," Irrelevant."
11071300,11072300," Irrelevant."
11072300,11073300," Irrelevant."
11073300,11074300," Okay."
11074300,11075300," So..."
11075300,11076300," I'm so sorry."
11076300,11079300," This is a joke, by the way."
11079300,11082300," I'm just joking, okay?"
11082300,11086300," I'm only learning Vulcan, and just give me some time."
11086300,11091140," I just want to play around with the concepts, and maybe I will look into ""Ash"" a little bit."
11091140,11096140," Don't take me too seriously, okay?"
11096140,11097920," Sometimes people take me way too serious."
11097920,11099920," I'm just shitposting on the internet."
11099920,11100920," Come on."
11100920,11104920," I'm just a meme-er, and I mean my life away, away."
11104920,11104920," All right."
11104920,11106920," I'm just a meme-er, and I mean my life away."
11106920,11118920," I'm just a meme-er, and I mean my life away, away."
11118920,11119920," All right."
11119920,11123920," I'm just a meme-er."
11123920,11126920," So what do we have in here?"
11126920,11127920," Does it even build?"
11127920,11134920," Let me see if I can even build this into it, I think."
11134920,11135920," All right."
11135920,11137920," So render pass abstract."
11137920,11142920," Okay."
11142920,11144920," It's in the frame buffer."
11154920,11155920," Sorry."
11155920,11161920," So it's all available in here."
11161920,11162920," Uh-huh."
11162920,11168920," So let's try to do that."
11169920,11170920," So I didn't pause."
11170920,11175920," Is this gonna fucking compile?"
11175920,11177920," Is this gonna fucking compile, mate?"
11177920,11179920," Holy fucking shit, mate."
11179920,11180920," All right."
11180920,11182920," So this shit fucking compiled."
11182920,11184920," Can you believe that?"
11184920,11185920," Uh-huh."
11185920,11186920," Okay."
11186920,11187920," So it's gonna be v21."
11187920,11190920," And we're gonna follow this tutorial now."
11190920,11191920," Uh-huh."
11191920,11192920," The one for 022."
11192920,11193920," Uh-huh."
11193920,11195920," The one for 022."
11195920,11196920," The one for 022."
11196920,11199920," The one for 022."
11199920,11201920," So render pass."
11201920,11202920," We created a render pass."
11202920,11203920," Pipeline."
11203920,11204920," Uh-huh."
11204920,11205920," Pipeline."
11205920,11206920," We..."
11206920,11207920," It was very difficult to create a pipeline."
11207920,11208920," So..."
11208920,11209920," Uh-huh."
11209920,11211920," We're not creating it yet."
11211920,11213920," So..."
11213920,11215920," And the next thing we need to do..."
11215920,11216920," After the dynamic state..."
11216920,11217920," Oh."
11217920,11218920," We need to implement this function first."
11218920,11219920," Yes."
11219920,11220920," Yes."
11220920,11221920," Yes."
11221920,11222920," Yes."
11222920,11223920," Uh-huh."
11223920,11224920," So what are we doing?"
11224920,11225920," Uh..."
11225920,11226920," We take images."
11226920,11227920," Right."
11227920,11228920," And we take the first one."
11228920,11229920," Uh..."
11229920,11231920," And we take its dimensions."
11231920,11234920," Um..."
11234920,11235920," Let dimension..."
11235920,11236920," Uh..."
11236920,11237920," Dimensions."
11237920,11238920," Uh..."
11238920,11239920," It's gonna be something like this."
11239920,11240920," Uh..."
11240920,11243920," And then we need to construct something called Viewport."
11243920,11245920," And I wonder if Viewport is a..."
11245920,11247920," A concept of Vulcana."
11247920,11248920," Yes."
11248920,11250920," It kind of is."
11250920,11251920," Yeah."
11251920,11252920," So..."
11252920,11255920," It is sort of a concept of Vulcana."
11255920,11256920," Uh-huh."
11256920,11257920," Uh-huh."
11257920,11259920," So do we have a pipeline?"
11259920,11261920," So we already have a pipeline in there."
11261920,11263920," But we don't have a pipeline viewport."
11263920,11266920," So probably we'll have to do it like this."
11266920,11267920," Uh..."
11267920,11268920," Uh..."
11268920,11269920," Pipeline viewport."
11269920,11270920," Okay."
11270920,11271920," So..."
11271920,11275920," We need to construct a new viewport if the window got resized."
11275920,11276920," So it's gonna be viewport."
11276920,11277920," Uh..."
11277920,11278920," Viewport."
11278920,11282920," So the origin is gonna start at 0, 0."
11282920,11283920," Uh..."
11283920,11284920," Uh..."
11284920,11285920," Then dimensions."
11285920,11286920," Uh..."
11286920,11287920," Then dimensions."
11287920,11288920," Um..."
11288920,11289920," This is very strange."
11289920,11294920," Can you just, like, map this entire thing into..."
11294920,11294920," Maybe not."
11294920,11295920," Maybe you have to reconstruct it."
11295920,11306920," But it would be kind of cool if you could just take the dimensions and map them, uh..."
11306920,11307920," Like this."
11307920,11309920," If you know what I mean."
11309920,11312920," And just use dimensions directly in here."
11312920,11313920," Uh..."
11313920,11316920," I wonder if that will work."
11316920,11317920," But, uh..."
11317920,11318920," So let's not experiment right now."
11318920,11321920," Let's actually make it compile first."
11321920,11323920," And then we may try to improve it."
11323920,11324920," Uh..."
11324920,11325920," Dimensions."
11325920,11328920," It's gonna be 0 as F32."
11328920,11331920," Dimensions 1 as F32."
11331920,11332920," Okay."
11332920,11335920," So after that we have a depth range."
11335920,11336920," Uh..."
11336920,11338920," And I suppose this is a range of Z."
11338920,11339920," All right."
11339920,11341920," For depth and stuff."
11341920,11344920," And it's gonna be a range from 0 to 1."
11344920,11345920," Uh..."
11345920,11347920," I don't know why it is important to customize this kind of stuff."
11347920,11348920," But okay."
11348920,11349920," So..."
11349920,11352920," And then we set viewports like this."
11352920,11355920," And after that is viewport even needed."
11355920,11357920," So do we even use view..."
11357920,11358920," Okay."
11358920,11359920," That's really interesting."
11359920,11363920," So we create a viewport once just to set it in here like that."
11363920,11365920," But couldn't we set it directly?"
11365920,11368920," Why does it have to be like a separate thing in here?"
11368920,11369920," So this is..."
11369920,11372920," I think this is another thing that could be maybe inlined at least."
11372920,11374920," So then we take dynamic state."
11374920,11375920," Uh..."
11375920,11376920," Viewports."
11376920,11381920," We call some vec viewport."
11381920,11383920," Actually a single viewport."
11383920,11384920," Uh..."
11384920,11386920," Then we're taking the images."
11386920,11389920," We're mapping each individual image."
11389920,11390920," We take..."
11390920,11395920," We create a new image view."
11395920,11399920," And we recreate all of these things in there."
11399920,11400920," Uh..."
11400920,11401920," Huh..."
11401920,11402920," All right."
11402920,11403920," Oh, I see."
11403920,11404920," Okay."
11404920,11407920," So if the..."
11407920,11408920," Holy shit!"
11408920,11410920," I think I'm understanding."
11410920,11422920," So if the size of the window changed, we literally have to take all of our images of the swap chain and create them from scratch with the new size."
11422920,11423920," Explicitly."
11423920,11424920," Okay."
11424920,11425920," That is very interesting."
11425920,11426920," Like literally manually."
11426920,11427920," So you have an array of these swap chain images."
11427920,11428920," Something changed?"
11428920,11429920," Yeah."
11429920,11430920," Remove the previous ones."
11430920,11442920," Which is probably done by automatic memory management of like of Arc or something like that."
11442920,11444920," And create the new ones."
11444920,11445920," Yes."
11445920,11447920," I guess that's how we do."
11447920,11448920," Um..."
11448920,11455920," I wonder if you can just create big images for swap chain."
11455920,11456920," Like very, very big."
11456920,11464920," And when the window size changes, you just take the sub range of this image and you don't have to recreate things too much."
11464920,11468920," So maybe you have like an upper limit of how big your window can be."
11468920,11471920," So you don't spend too much time doing these kind of things."
11471920,11472920," But it's just like a theoretical thing."
11472920,11473920," Right?"
11473920,11474920," You know what I'm talking about?"
11474920,11478920," Well, because that's how I usually do when I program like in C."
11478920,11480920," Like when I make a grid based game."
11480920,11486920," And in a grid based game, like window can resize, which will increase the size of the grid."
11486920,11488920," I will just play like it like a huge array."
11488920,11491920," And so I don't have to resize the array or something like that."
11491920,11493920," Just like take a bigger sub array."
11493920,11495920," And there's a limit on how big you can make a window."
11495920,11497920," So you don't spend too much time."
11497920,11499920," But I mean, it's like, it's whatever."
11499920,11504920," It's just like a stylistic thing, more of it."
11504920,11507920," All right."
11507920,11513920," Very interesting."
11513920,11518920," I suppose OpenGL just does all of that for you implicitly."
11518920,11522920," But in Vulcan, you have to do everything explicitly."
11522920,11532920," Do you guys like Vulcan so far?"
11532920,11535920," You guys think it's going to be the future of game development?"
11535920,11536920," What?"
11536920,11537920," What?"
11537920,11538920," What?"
11538920,11539920," What?"
11539920,11540920," What?"
11540920,11541920," Are we game yet?"
11541920,11542920," Are we game yet?"
11542920,11543920," What?"
11543920,11544920," I'm sorry."
11544920,11545920," I'm sorry."
11573920,11574920," Okay."
11574920,11576920," So we take all of the images."
11576920,11577920," Images."
11577920,11579920," And we are iterating through this entire stuff."
11579920,11581920," And we're mapping all of that."
11581920,11582920," So here's the image."
11582920,11589920," So what I'm doing in here is image clone."
11589920,11591920," Right."
11591920,11592920," And I take the image view."
11592920,11594920," And I create a new image view."
11594920,11595920," Right."
11595920,11598920," Right."
11598920,11600920," And then I create a completely new thing."
11600920,11602920," Did I already create frame buffer?"
11602920,11603920," Before."
11603920,11604920," Oh yeah."
11604920,11608920," This is the first time I'm creating everything in here anyway."
11608920,11609920," So."
11609920,11610920," Yeah."
11610920,11611920," That makes sense."
11611920,11612920," All right."
11612920,11613920," So frame."
11613920,11614920," Buffer."
11614920,11615920," Start."
11615920,11616920," Render."
11616920,11617920," Pass."
11617920,11618920," Cool on."
11618920,11621920," So then I add the view."
11621920,11622920," Build."
11622920,11623920," The frame buffer."
11623920,11624920," Uh-huh."
11624920,11625920," Build."
11625920,11626920," The frame buffer."
11626920,11627920," And it."
11627920,11630920," On any of these things."
11630920,11631920," Eh."
11631920,11634920," I mean."
11634920,11638920," You could probably do something like end."
11638920,11639920," Then."
11639920,11641920," But it's not going to be super convenient."
11641920,11642920," I think it's."
11642920,11643920," This is a little bit more convenient."
11643920,11644920," To do like that."
11644920,11645920," Ah."
11645920,11646920," So after that."
11646920,11647920," We're going to wrap it into an arc."
11647920,11648920," For reference counting."
11648920,11649920," Capabilities."
11649920,11650920," Right."
11650920,11651920," And then."
11651920,11652920," Do it as this."
11652920,11653920," Frame buffer."
11653920,11654920," Abstract."
11654920,11655920," Plus send."
11655920,11656920," Plus sync."
11656920,11657920," And."
11657920,11658920," Maybe I'm going to actually."
11658920,11659920," Format the buffer."
11659920,11660920," Maybe not."
11660920,11661920," Yeah."
11661920,11662920," I'm falling asleep yet."
11662920,11663920," Okay."
11663920,11664920," And after that."
11664920,11665920," I need to."
11665920,11666920," Collect that."
11666920,11667920," Into a vector."
11667920,11668920," Oh my god."
11668920,11669920," Emacs."
11669920,11670920," Emacs."
11670920,11671920," Emacs."
11671920,11672920," There we go."
11672920,11673920," All right."
11673920,11674920," So."
11674920,11675920," That should."
11675920,11676920," Kind of."
11676920,11677920," Do the trick."
11677920,11678920," Oh my god."
11678920,11679920," Emacs."
11679920,11680920," Emacs."
11680920,11681920," Emacs."
11681920,11682920," There we go."
11682920,11683920," All right."
11683920,11684920," Do the trick."
11684920,11685920," I think."
11685920,11686920," I think."
11686920,11687920," That should."
11687920,11688920," Kind of."
11688920,11689920," Do the trick."
11689920,11690920," But it does not compile."
11690920,11691920," Because we don't have."
11691920,11692920," Image view."
11692920,11693920," Do we have."
11693920,11694920," Image view."
11694920,11695920," Available in here."
11695920,11696920," Uh huh."
11696920,11697920," So I'm going to."
11697920,11698920," Take that."
11698920,11699920," Uh."
11699920,11700920," I'm going to put it."
11700920,11701920," In here."
11701920,11702920," Uh huh."
11702920,11704920," Is it going to compile now?"
11704920,11705920," Uh."
11705920,11706920," For the semicolon."
11706920,11707920," Uh."
11707920,11708920," For the semicolon."
11708920,11709920," Uh."
11709920,11710920," For the semicolon."
11710920,11711920," Uh huh."
11711920,11712920," Uh huh."
11712920,11713920," Uh huh."
11713920,11714920," Uh huh."
11714920,11715920," Uh huh."
11715920,11716920," Uh huh."
11716920,11717920," And."
11717920,11718920," I think."
11718920,11719920," This."
11719920,11720920," Seems to be compiling."
11720920,11721920," It seems to be compiling."
11721920,11722920," It seems to be compiling."
11722920,11723920," So far."
11723920,11724920," Um."
11724920,11725920," Let's try to call this function now."
11725920,11726920," Right."
11726920,11727920," Uh."
11727920,11728920," So this is going to be a triangle."
11728920,11729920," Um."
11729920,11730920," This is going to be a triangle."
11730920,11731920," Um."
11731920,11732920," This is going to be a triangle."
11732920,11733920," And."
11733920,11734920," Uh."
11734920,11735920," Where do we call this function?"
11735920,11736920," So we call it."
11736920,11737920," In the event loop."
11737920,11738920," And."
11738920,11739920," When we initialize."
11739920,11740920," The frame buffers."
11740920,11741920," Right."
11741920,11742920," When we are initializing."
11742920,11743920," The frame buffers."
11743920,11744920," Right."
11744920,11745920," When we are initializing."
11745920,11746920," The frame buffers."
11746920,11747920," So we are initializing."
11747920,11748920," The frame buffers."
11748920,11749920," So we are initializing."
11749920,11750920," The frame buffers."
11750920,11751920," After we created."
11751920,11752920," The dynamic state."
11752920,11753920," Here is the dynamic state."
11753920,11754920," So that makes sense."
11754920,11755920," Uh."
11755920,11756920," All right."
11756920,11757920," So it's going to."
11757920,11758920," Let's mute."
11758920,11759920," Frame buffers."
11759920,11760920," Right."
11760920,11761920," Then we take the window."
11761920,11762920," Size."
11762920,11763920," Dependent."
11763920,11764920," Setup."
11764920,11765920," So the function that we just created."
11765920,11766920," We're providing the images."
11766920,11767920," Uh."
11767920,11768920," Render."
11768920,11769920," Pass."
11769920,11770920," Clone."
11770920,11771920," And then."
11771920,11772920," Uh."
11772920,11773920," Mutable."
11773920,11774920," Dynamic state."
11774920,11775920," Uh huh."
11775920,11776920," Mutable."
11776920,11777920," Dynamic state."
11777920,11778920," So that should work."
11778920,11779920," And I can try to."
11779920,11780920," Maybe bring this frame buffers."
11780920,11781920," Uh."
11781920,11782920," Just in case."
11782920,11783920," Just to see what's going to happen."
11783920,11784920," Uh."
11784920,11785920," Did I save it?"
11785920,11786920," I think I saved everything."
11786920,11787920," So it doesn't compile."
11787920,11788920," Let's find out why."
11788920,11789920," Uh."
11789920,11791920," This is because this thing is not printable."
11791920,11792920," Okay."
11792920,11793920," So it's not printable."
11793920,11795920," There's nothing much you can do here anyway."
11795920,11796920," Um."
11796920,11797920," But apart from that."
11797920,11798920," I think it's compelling."
11798920,11801920," What type is image images."
11801920,11803920," I think it's a array of images."
11803920,11804920," Oh."
11804920,11806920," You can see the type in here."
11806920,11807920," Here."
11807920,11808920," Here's the type."
11808920,11809920," It's a slice."
11809920,11810920," Uh."
11810920,11811920," Sequence essentially."
11811920,11812920," Of arcs."
11812920,11813920," Of swap chain images."
11813920,11814920," Over a specific."
11814920,11815920," Uh."
11815920,11816920," Of a specific window."
11816920,11817920," That's what it is."
11817920,11817920," Uh."
11817920,11818920," Hopefully that."
11818920,11819920," That helps you."
11819920,11820920," Okay."
11820920,11821920," So."
11821920,11822920," Uh."
11822920,11823920," The next thing."
11823920,11824920," Is going to be."
11824920,11825920," A triangle."
11825920,11826920," And."
11826920,11827920," Yeah."
11827920,11828920," So the render pass."
11828920,11829920," Uh."
11829920,11830920," We created above."
11830920,11831920," Only describes the layout."
11831920,11832920," Of the frame bars."
11832920,11833920," Before."
11833920,11834920," We can."
11834920,11835920," Blah blah blah."
11835920,11836920," Uh."
11836920,11837920," Initialization."
11837920,11838920," Is."
11838920,11839920," Finally."
11839920,11840920," Finished."
11840920,11842920," In some situations."
11842920,11843920," The swap chain."
11843920,11844920," Will become invalid."
11844920,11845920," By itself."
11845920,11846920," This includes."
11846920,11847920," For example."
11847920,11848920," When the window."
11848920,11849920," Is resized."
11849920,11850920," The swap chain."
11850920,11851920," Will no longer match."
11851920,11852920," The windows."
11852920,11853920," The windows."
11853920,11854920," Or on android."
11854920,11855920," When the application."
11855920,11856920," Went to the background."
11856920,11857920," And goes back."
11857920,11858920," To the foreground."
11858920,11859920," In this situations."
11859920,11860920," Acquiring."
11860920,11861920," A swap chain image."
11861920,11862920," Or presenting it."
11862920,11863920," Will return."
11863920,11864920," An error."
11864920,11865920," Rendering."
11865920,11866920," An image."
11866920,11867920," Of that swap chain."
11867920,11868920," Will not produce."
11868920,11869920," Any error."
11869920,11870920," But may or may not work."
11870920,11871920," To continue rendering."
11871920,11872920," We need to recreate."
11872920,11873920," The swap chain."
11873920,11874920," By creating."
11874920,11875920," A new swap chain."
11875920,11876920," Here."
11876920,11877920," We remember."
11877920,11878920," That."
11878920,11879920," Okay."
11879920,11880920," That's very interesting."
11880920,11881920," So there's a special variable."
11881920,11882920," Where we keep track."
11882920,11883920," Where."
11883920,11884920," That we need to recreate."
11884920,11885920," The swap chain."
11885920,11886920," Right."
11886920,11887920," And swap chain."
11887920,11888920," May get invalidated."
11888920,11889920," At any point."
11889920,11890920," Okay."
11890920,11891920," In the loop."
11891920,11892920," In the loop."
11892920,11893920," Below."
11893920,11894920," We're going to submit."
11894920,11895920," Commands."
11895920,11896920," To the GPU."
11896920,11897920," Submitting a command."
11897920,11898920," Produces."
11898920,11899920," An object."
11899920,11900920," That implements."
11900920,11901920," The GPU."
11901920,11902920," Future."
11902920,11903920," Trait."
11903920,11904920," Which holds."
11904920,11905920," The resources."
11905920,11906920," For."
11906920,11907920," As long."
11907920,11908920," As they are."
11908920,11909920," In use."
11909920,11910920," By the GPU."
11910920,11911920," In order to avoid."
11911920,11912920," That."
11912920,11913920," We store."
11913920,11914920," The submission."
11914920,11915920," Of the previous."
11915920,11916920," Frame."
11916920,11917920," Here."
11917920,11918920," All right."
11918920,11919920," So."
11919920,11920920," We use."
11920920,11921920," Something."
11921920,11922920," Called sync."
11922920,11923920," Previous frame."
11923920,11924920," And."
11924920,11925920," Is it."
11925920,11926920," Is."
11926920,11927920," Is sync."
11927920,11928920," Basically."
11928920,11929920," STD sync."
11929920,11930920," Is it."
11930920,11931920," STD sync."
11931920,11932920," I think."
11932920,11933920," I think it is."
11933920,11934920," Oh yeah."
11934920,11935920," I see."
11935920,11936920," I see sync."
11936920,11937920," Yeah."
11937920,11938920," It's a volcano sync."
11938920,11940920," Let's put it in here."
11940920,11941920," Sync."
11941920,11945920," So."
11945920,11946920," Previous frame."
11946920,11947920," And."
11947920,11948920," Previous frame."
11948920,11949920," And."
11949920,11950920," Let's."
11950920,11951920," Mute."
11951920,11952920," Previous."
11952920,11953920," Frame."
11953920,11954920," End."
11954920,11955920," Some."
11955920,11956920," Sync."
11956920,11957920," Now."
11957920,11958920," Not new."
11958920,11959920," Now."
11959920,11960920," Device."
11960920,11961920," Clone."
11961920,11962920," And."
11962920,11963920," We make."
11963920,11964920," Boxed."
11964920,11965920," And."
11965920,11966920," There we go."
11966920,11967920," So."
11967920,11968920," This is needed."
11968920,11969920," For some reason."
11969920,11970920," Okay."
11970920,11971920," So."
11971920,11972920," Then we."
11972920,11973920," So."
11973920,11974920," This is the entire event loop."
11974920,11975920," Okay."
11975920,11976920," This is essentially."
11976920,11977920," An entire."
11977920,11978920," Event loop."
11978920,11979920," Alrighty."
11979920,11980920," Event."
11980920,11981920," Event."
11981920,11982920," Loop."
11982920,11983920," Run."
11983920,11984920," Move."
11984920,11985920," Event."
11985920,11986920," Control."
11986920,11987920," Flow."
11987920,11988920," Control."
11988920,11989920," Flow."
11989920,11990920," Control."
11990920,11991920," Flow."
11991920,11991920," And."
11991920,11992920," Then."
11992920,11993920," We do this entire thing."
11993920,11994920," Right."
11994920,11995920," Match."
11995920,11996920," Events."
11996920,11997920," Right."
11997920,11998920," So."
11998920,11999920," We're just looking for."
11999920,12000920," Very specific events."
12000920,12001920," And stuff like that."
12001920,12002920," Oh."
12002920,12003920," It's actually kind of similar to."
12003920,12004920," Event loop."
12004920,12005920," That I developed for."
12005920,12006920," RCUI thingy."
12006920,12007920," Remember."
12007920,12008920," Yeah."
12008920,12009920," Is that how it's called?"
12009920,12010920," Yeah."
12010920,12011920," So."
12011920,12012920," I was developing like a."
12012920,12013920," I guess."
12013920,12014920," It's a pretty natural idea."
12014920,12015920," To have UI like that."
12015920,12016920," Event loop."
12016920,12017920," I mean."
12017920,12018920," Yeah."
12018920,12019920," No."
12019920,12020920," It's actually kind of different."
12020920,12020920," Yeah."
12020920,12021920," It's kind of different."
12021920,12022920," I think."
12022920,12023920," It's."
12023920,12024920," It was my previous situation."
12024920,12025920," My previous situation."
12025920,12026920," Kind of looked like that."
12026920,12027920," Yeah."
12027920,12028920," No."
12028920,12029920," It's actually kind of different."
12029920,12030920," Yeah."
12030920,12031920," It's kind of different."
12031920,12032920," I think."
12032920,12033920," Was my previous situation."
12033920,12034920," My previous situation."
12034920,12035920," Kind of looked like that."
12035920,12036920," But yeah."
12036920,12037920," So."
12037920,12038920," We can set."
12038920,12039920," Control flow exit."
12039920,12040920," And that means."
12040920,12041920," It will basically exit."
12041920,12042920," On the next iteration."
12042920,12043920," Of event loop."
12043920,12044920," To be fair."
12044920,12045920," I'm not a big fan."
12045920,12046920," Of this."
12046920,12047920," Like."
12047920,12048920," Event loops."
12048920,12049920," Where you provide."
12049920,12050920," A lambda."
12050920,12051920," And stuff like that."
12051920,12052920," I kind of prefer."
12052920,12053920," Like."
12053920,12054920," Explicitly."
12054920,12055920," Having my loop."
12055920,12056920," And have functions."
12056920,12057920," That poll events."
12057920,12058920," I think."
12058920,12059920," Like."
12059920,12060920," It gives you."
12060920,12061920," A little bit more."
12061920,12063920," On us anyway."
12063920,12068920," So."
12068920,12069920," Redraw event."
12069920,12070920," Cleared."
12070920,12071920," And."
12071920,12072920," Okay."
12072920,12073920," So."
12073920,12074920," That's a."
12074920,12075920," That's a huge."
12075920,12076920," Event handling."
12076920,12077920," Not gonna lie."
12077920,12078920," It's a pretty huge."
12078920,12079920," But."
12079920,12080920," There's a lot of comments."
12080920,12081920," Here as well."
12081920,12082920," So."
12082920,12083920," I don't think."
12083920,12084920," It's that."
12084920,12085920," It's that bad."

12221920,12222920," Rust."
12222920,12223920," First."
12223920,12224920," Triangle."
12224920,12225920," Is that a good title?"
12225920,12226920," Uh."
12226920,12227920," Um."
12227920,12228920," Yeah."
12228920,12229920," I think it's a pretty good title."
12229920,12229920," So."
12229920,12230920," Let's actually do that."
12230920,12231920," Um."
12231920,12232920," Um."
12232920,12235920," 9:00 PM."
12235920,12236920," You're talking."
12236920,12237920," Oh."
12237920,12238920," Yeah."
12238920,12239920," We still have a little bit of sun."
12239920,12240920," If that's what you're talking about."
12240920,12241920," Um."
12241920,12242920," Hmm."
12242920,12243920," Hmm."
12243920,12244920," Hmm."
12244920,12245920," Hmm."
12245920,12246920," All right."
12246920,12247920," So."
12247920,12257920," And we don't have like a summertime saving thingy anymore."
12257920,12258920," I think."
12258920,12259920," I think we discussed that."
12259920,12260920," Yeah."
12260920,12261920," Thank you."
12261920,12262920," Mr. Putin."
12262920,12263920," Very cool."
12263920,12267920," Very, very cool."
12267920,12268920," Okay."
12268920,12269920," So."
12269920,12270920," Christ."
12270920,12272920," The sun."
12272920,12273920," Uh."
12273920,12274920," So."
12274920,12275920," This is a boxed."
12275920,12276920," And."
12276920,12279920," I wonder what I forgot to."
12279920,12280920," Yeah."
12280920,12281920," So."
12281920,12284920," I also have a sync."
12284920,12285920," Uh."
12285920,12286920," Sync."
12286920,12287920," Yeah."
12287920,12288920," So."
12288920,12290920," Maybe I need to import these things."
12290920,12293920," Hmm."
12293920,12294920," Oh."
12294920,12295920," Yeah."
12295920,12296920," I guess."
12296920,12297920," I guess that was."
12297920,12298920," That's what was needed."
12298920,12299920," Uh."
12299920,12300920," Okay."
12300920,12301920," Now we're talking."
12301920,12302920," Uh."
12302920,12303920," Oh yeah."
12303920,12304920," So."
12304920,12305920," No."
12305920,12306920," We don't have any other pattern matches."
12306920,12307920," So."
12307920,12308920," In a."
12308920,12309920," In an example."
12309920,12311920," How do we handle the events?"
12311920,12312920," How do we handle the events?"
12312920,12313920," How do we handle the events?"
12313920,12314920," So."
12314920,12315920," Yeah."
12315920,12318920," The default value for a known event is just do nothing."
12318920,12319920," Nothing."
12319920,12320920," Okay."
12320920,12321920," Uh."
12321920,12322920," It's just do nothing."
12322920,12323920," Just do nothing."
12323920,12324920," Just do nothing."
12324920,12325920," Mm-hmm."
12325920,12329920," So it's gonna be something like."
12329920,12330920," Uh."
12330920,12331920," Like this."
12331920,12332920," And I also wanna format."
12332920,12333920," Uh."
12333920,12334920," Format the buffer."
12334920,12335920," Okay."
12335920,12336920," So if I try to compile this entire thing."
12336920,12337920," It should compile."
12337920,12338920," Hopefully."
12338920,12339920," Um."
12339920,12340920," Um."
12340920,12341920," It's Vulcan pain."
12341920,12342920," Uh."
12342920,12343920," Oh."
12343920,12344920," Shit."
12344920,12345920," We created a window."
12345920,12368300," is vulcan pain uh oh shit we created a window after three and a half hours three hours 25 minutes"
12368300,12378780," we created a window you can't close it by the way you can't close it because we don't handle the"
12378780,12383860," close event right we don't have to handle the close event but we managed to create a window"
12383860,12388320," uh with a vulcan context isn't that amazing"
12388320,12403820," oh boy oh boy okay so um is it broken you can do kill all broken and i think it died yeah i think it"
12403820,12414460," got terminated it got terminated uh yeah stream is over yeah exactly because but yet not yet stream"
12414460,12424700," is not over it's not over till it's over okay uh i want to see some triangle action today to be fair"
12424700,12430480," i want to see some triangle action so let's try to handle the close event so it's going to be window"
12430480,12440820," event and if the event is window event close requested right and we ignore everything else"
12440820,12451060," uh in that particular case we just take the control flow uh and set it to control flow exit"
12451060,12459460," that's what we do essentially that's what we do so uh let's see if now um we can close the window"
12459460,12467060," we can't even compile that okay so all of that stuff uh event and everything yeah"
12467060,12475860," yeah i guess we need to have it in here as well uh oh shit uh-huh let's put it here"
12475860,12476740," fuck"
12476740,12480020," triangle"
12488020,12506820," all right all right so we have to wait and i think it should"
12506820,12514980," it takes extra time okay so finally it works now can i close it i can close it so we do handle the"
12514980,12522500," close event cool uh we do handle close event uh so what's going to be the next event that we need to"
12522500,12531380," close to handle what's going to be the next event uh the next one i suppose is resize right so in case"
12531380,12542500," of our size we have to uh holy fucking shit so the redraw event clear cleared is 139 lines"
12542500,12557620," okay so um all right so what do we have in here uh event window event uh event window event resized"
12560100,12571940," uh resized uh so recreate swap chain so basically a reminder that we need to recreate this swap chain"
12571940,12576660," so and recreating the swap chain is going to be done in uh in this particular event cool"
12578820,12595780," uh"
12595780,12605220," we still like i still i think i still have uh some piece of code commented out yeah i still don't need this"
12605220,12613940," pipeline that's what's weird about it like i still don't need it um okay so let's go and we need to"
12613940,12621140," implement the last event we just need to handle the last event right this one uh actually this one"
12621140,12628820," yes uh redraw events cleared and we're gonna have something on the screen hopefully um i don't know"
12628820,12635140," yet but we'll see we'll see we'll see oh i'm a little bit tired like it's like oh holy shit"
12635140,12642820," but i'm almost done but i'm almost done"
12647780,12656100," and we'll also recreate the whole thing in here"
12656100,12660580," so redraw events cleared"
12660580,12663940," oh boy"
12668580,12675620," so suppose here we're just doing this thing right okay let me open triangle"
12675620,12683460," it is important to call this function from time to time otherwise resources will keep accumulating"
12683460,12687060," and you will eventually reach an out of memory error"
12688740,12696420," calling this uh function pulse various fences in order to determine what the gpu has already processed"
12696420,12707460," and freeze the resources that are no longer needed"
12711940,12720900," garbage literally garbage collector uh okay i'm not i'm not even commenting on any of this right i'm not"
12720900,12728420," even commenting because like it's it's pointless um all right whenever the window resizes we need to"
12728420,12735300," recreate everything dependent on the window size uh in this example that includes the swap chain the frame"
12735300,12743300," buffers and the dynamic state viewport all right so uh recreate uh swap chain okay"
12743300,12750580," um so we take the surface window inner size and here we have the dimensions"
12750580,12754260," right here are the dimensions"
12754260,12761860," uh and we need to recreate the swap chain with the dimensions but that can fail actually"
12762900,12766020," right uh right uh this error tends to happen when the user is"
12766020,12773940," ah mainly residing the window simply restarting the loop is the easiest way to fix this uh"
12773940,12790420," okay um cool so we're gonna do swap chain uh recreate uh with dimensions and we provide the"
12790420,12797220," dimensions that we just got from the window okay so and if it successfully happened here here it is here"
12797220,12806260," is the new swap chain uh and if we got something like swap chain uh creation error which is unsupported"
12806260,12814820," uh dimensions we just go to the next uh iteration of event loop if we got something else uh if we got"
12814820,12826340," something else we'll need to panic uh failed to recreate swap chain because of uh this situation there we go"
12826340,12837380," because of this situation very cool and um so then i'm gonna do new swap chain new images and here is"
12837380,12847380," everything new in here uh there we go and then uh yeah we have an old swap chain and we need to assign a"
12847380,12854500," new swap chain to the uh to the old one right like this so then we need to recreate the frame buffers"
12854500,12863700," uh window size dependent setup we provide the new images then render pass we need to clone it yet again"
12864500,12869460," i suppose when i do clone on an arc what i'm essentially doing i'm not cloning the object"
12869460,12876420," but i'm rather cloning the reference counting pointer and cloning will actually increment the"
12876420,12882020," the reference count this is probably why we have a lot of clones in here so let me let me check it out"
12882020,12890980," so what about arc uh let me see because i want to see uh so invoking clone and arc produces a new arc"
12890980,12896740," instance which points to the same location on the heap as the source okay i actually yeah this is why"
12896740,12902020," the yeah remember how since the beginning of this stream i was like why they keep cloning this entire"
12902020,12907380," shit why they keep cloning they're not cloning the objects they're cloning arcs and cloning the arc just"
12907380,12912340," increments the reference counter but i'm still wondering can we just get rid of arcs altogether"
12912340,12920740," like we're not having like a very huge uh like hierarchy structure system like where different"
12920740,12927860," systems may own the same uh the same resource we actually have like a like a single like namespace"
12927860,12932100," where we could probably get rid of the all of the arcs or something i just don't understand why"
12932100,12939060," why do we use it in here i think it feels like a little bit of an overkill but i'm not sure yet so i just"
12939060,12944820," want to finish the example until it actually works and only then once we have a working example we can"
12944820,12950740," see we can try to do different things um and see if they're possible or not maybe the library actually"
12950740,12957220," limits uh like what kind of stuff we can do anyway okay so now at least it makes sense now this makes sense"
12959780,12972180," all right all right so okay here's the frame buffers and all the sh*t then mute dynamic state uh and uh"
12972180,12981620," so we managed to successfully recreate uh swap chain i suppose swap chain and make it equal to false"
12982740,12991780," so uh yes yes yes kawaii for kundesu um yeah we can try to run this again this uh problem now"
12991780,13005860," swap chain creation error uh swap chain creation error and i suppose i might as well well all right"
13007140,13021060," uh swap chain we have an image um let's put swap chain creation creation error swap chain creation error"
13021060,13021940," is it gonna work now"
13021940,13034900," uh no swap chain creation error okay oh i need it just a second yeah because it's it's a regular swap chain i'm"
13034900,13048740," sorry sorry uh swap chain yeah uh this should be some way here"
13048740,13052740," you use to use to kawaii fork in this meat"
13064500,13071300," okay okay so now uh every time we resize here uh we're actually recreating the swap chain"
13071300,13077060," but we have no way to confirm that it's actually the the case because we don't have any side effects"
13077060,13083860," visible at least at least visible side effects um all right so let's continue uh developing this entire"
13083860,13085220," thing triangle"
13085220,13094100," recreate swap chain uh recreate swap chain and what do we have before we can"
13094100,13099940," draw on the output you can draw on the output you we have to acquire an image from the swap chain"
13099940,13104180," if no image is available which happens if you submit draw commands too quickly"
13104180,13111780," then the function will block this operation returns an index of the image that we are allowed to draw upon"
13111780,13116500," this function can block if no image is available the parameter is on the optional timeout"
13117300,13126420," after which the function call will return an error okay so we have a swap chain acquire next image in a swap"
13126420,13131540," chain okay that actually makes sense so we need to acquire the image oh that's that's pretty cool"
13131540,13137860," so swap chain is an object you have to acquire the next new image and oh my god okay that's that makes"
13137860,13144740," sense i suppose uh so we have image numbers sub optimal acquire future and it's even a future of course"
13144740,13154100," um acquire next image can be successful but sub optimal this means that this uh swap chain image will"
13154100,13160580," still work but it may not display correctly with some drivers this can be when the window resizes but"
13160580,13170820," the it may not cause the swap chain to become out of the date oh okay you have to handle even this kind"
13170820,13181620," of situations okay interesting very interesting um all right so let's do swap uh chain acquire next image"
13181620,13190980," so we take the swap chain and we clone uh yeah i suppose we i i can see now the library itself requires"
13190980,13196100," you to have arc so that's why you won't be even able to do anything about that like you won't be able"
13196100,13203060," to get rid of the arc yeah so listen yeah as you can see the library itself like forces arc upon you so"
13203060,13205540," it's probably not even possible to get rid of it"
13207940,13214180," all right all right so i guess it is what it is i mean it's if library wants us to to use it why we can"
13214180,13224660," so we acquire it and when we acquire it we also have a timeout right so yeah we can put it on a timeout"
13224660,13233540," and then we will match it uh right we can either get the um the image from the swap chain or it could be an"
13233540,13245140," acquire error uh acquire error uh acquire error out of date huh out of date so in that case we have to"
13245140,13253940," recreate swap chain and go to the next one uh all right so and then it's going to be error"
13255780,13266740," panic to panic failed to acquire next image so it means we failed because of an unknown uh reason so out"
13266740,13272900," of date is a well-known reason of not being able to acquire it but anything else is a known one so"
13272900,13275940," it's kind of important to fail"
13278180,13289140," uh so let me let me see image num suboptimal suboptimal and acquire future"
13289140,13292900," acquire future"
13292900,13297860," okay so let's let's do it like this"
13297860,13306980," uh so after we acquired everything if it's suboptimal we just have to not forget to recreate the swap chain"
13306980,13315380," right uh it's kind of interesting that the uh api itself gives you uh this kind of information and"
13315380,13320180," allows you to um to handle this kind of information this section very cool"
13320180,13331700," it is in fact very low level okay so and if we got something suboptimal right if we got something"
13331700,13336420," something suboptimal we need to mark it as uh recreate swap chain"
13336420,13348340," recreate swap chain uh okay so uh let me try to see if this still compiles or not um all right"
13348340,13356180," so let's go let's go let's go um yeah swap chain has to be uh like imported properly"
13356900,13385620," volcano swap chain so the clown uh all right so okay this seems to be all right"
13386900,13412820," i don't think it's actually pretty cool that throwing clown is a combination of 30 flushed and certain smug"
13413460,13420900," i think right so the eyes are from certain flushed but the mouth i think it's from the uh certain smug"
13420900,13423940," right if you if you check them something like smug"
13423940,13429220," yeah it's kind of yeah but it's a little bit down it it's put a little bit down to"
13429220,13432580," uh leave some place for the uh for the for the nose"
13433620,13440820," um right so everything seems to be uh working everything seems to be twerking oh and i cannot"
13440820,13446260," close it anymore that is very interesting why can't i close it anymore i'm trying to close"
13446260,13453060," it doesn't it doesn't doesn't close but they can at least interrupt um okay so"
13453060,13464340," all right let's continue um let's continue so this is going to be something like this"
13464340,13474580," image number all right so it's going to be image number sub optimal uh and we need to start clearing the"
13474580,13485780," things right clear values so uh huh so it's going to be zero uh i think i'm going to clear with"
13485780,13490820," maybe black color for now uh into there we go"
13490820,13497860," clear values specify the color to clear the frame buffer width uh for example blue in order to draw we"
13497860,13503540," have to build a command buffer the command buffer object holds the list of the commands that are"
13503540,13509300," going to be executed building the command buffer is an expensive operation usually few hundred"
13509300,13515140," microseconds but is known to be a hot path in the driver and is expected to be optimized"
13515140,13521220," not that we have to pass a q family when we create a command buffer the command buffer will only be executed"
13521780,13531300," on that given q family um okay so auto command buffer build the primary one submit okay"
13535700,13544660," all righty uh so let's create the the auto command buffer builder whatever the fuck it is um okay"
13544660,13553460," let's mute builder and we don't even use clear where do you use clear values you use clear will it's like"
13553460,13561780," down below oh okay you see um all right so it's going to be that auto command buffer builder primary"
13562660,13565780," one uh time submit um"
13565780,13572260," all right so device"
13572260,13577540," clone queue family"
13577540,13583620," and let's just unwrap this entire"
13583620,13591220," uh okay so that looks okay so let's see if this compiles i'm not gonna just uh i think i'm not gonna"
13591220,13596900," right away compile uh run it let's just try to build it because running does not necessarily work"
13596900,13599940," uh auto command buffer builder"
13610740,13629540," oh yeah i do have a command buffer uh auto command buffer command buffer in here uh huh so i'm gonna put it in here"
13629540,13638100," uh oh oh oh oh oh okay so this is gonna build now hopefully it's gonna be now"
13639380,13646020," so uh here's the error and let me take a look so it cannot use that yet so let's comment it out now"
13646020,13651700," it's not usable right now uh but we'll see we'll see"
13651700,13657300," okay"
13665860,13675540," so here's the builder and begin render path okay before we can draw we have to enter a render path"
13675540,13684180," there are two methods to do this draw in line and draw secondary the letter is a bit more advanced and is"
13684180,13689540," not covered here covered here the third parameter builds the list of values to clear the attachments with"
13690100,13694660," the npi is similar to the list of attachments when building the frame buffers except that only the"
13694660,13699060," attachment that use load clear appear in this list cool makes sense"
13699060,13709860," that makes absolute sense okay uh let me let me see let me see let me see so we're gonna be builder"
13710100,13723700," uh and uh begin render pass begin render pass and it's gonna be frame buffer image num oh yeah yeah so"
13723700,13730260," when we get an image we get that from from acquiring an image yeah yeah so that's actually pretty cool so"
13730260,13747300," swap chain acquires an image in the of the image in the swap chain uh right and then we can use that"
13747300,13755140," image in in the array of frame buffers uh okay that's that's pretty cool so and of course we clone it"
13755140,13771700," basically acquiring it uh in with reference counts and what not so then sub uh pass contents"
13771700,13786420," um i don't know how to how to do that okay okay so uh all right and here we're gonna do unwrap um"
13786420,13795940," we're now inside oh fuck oh shit oh fuck oh shit we're now inside the first sub pass of the render pass"
13795940,13801140," we add a draw command the last two parameters contain the list of the resources to pass to the shader"
13801140,13809380," since we used an empty pipeline object the object have to be that makes sense okay so we're going to"
13809380,13816740," do draw and then it's going to be pipe uh line so we take the pipe oh okay so this is where it becomes"
13816740,13823060," very interesting so i couldn't compile the pipeline because i didn't have an information to infer the type"
13823060,13830340," of the pipeline so i had to uh defer implementation of the pipeline up until this moment remember how"
13830340,13836180," somewhere in the middle of the stream i like i couldn't compile this thing so yeah and i just"
13836180,13842580," commented it out because it is needed here and this is the place where it gets enough context and"
13842580,13852340," enough information to defer the type so it's it's some sort of like a non-linear tutorial right sometimes"
13852340,13858740," you just need to not compile some things and uh only then they make it make sense"
13858740,13869460," uh all right so okay so this is going to do that and then we provide the dynamic uh dynamic state um"
13869460,13875780," dynamic state and then we take the vertex buffer right so we take the vertex buffer and then we clone"
13875780,13881300," it and the rest of this stuff is not important as the common set so we're going to just put it like this"
13881300,13894020," this uh so after that uh we're gonna do unwrap"
13903700,13914420," okay uh so here's that and um yeah so this is the last thing uh that we did in the builder right so"
13914420,13920580," this seems to be the last thing uh so let me try to compile it now and it should fail right uh it"
13920580,13929700," should fail uh because of this kind of stuff so sub pass content uh all right uh let me see it's a vulcano"
13929700,13931700," vulcano"
13931700,13934900," okay"
13934900,13939140," so let me put it like here like that"
13939140,13947780," uh command buffer uh and this is where we have to put this entire thing right so this is where it is"
13947780,13957860," uh and the last thing we don't have a pipeline clone uh so and this is where we have to uncomment this"
13957860,13964900," entire thing to understand and it still doesn't have enough information to do this shit interesting"
13966100,13978100," um so uh oh some sort of a trait is not satisfied okay the trait bone single buffer definition maybe we"
13978100,13985860," just have to have this the type actually contains a template um okay"
13988260,13993460," we need to indicate that the blade or the vertices the type uh actually contains the template created"
13993460,14000340," blah blah blah blah uh but it's only mentioned in here so it's only mentioned in here so i'm not"
14000340,14003460," quite sure uh where we can get that"
14005220,14014740," so it is available somewhere here uh huh and maybe i can basically import it from from that right"
14014740,14023300," oh wait maybe i was looking at the uh the triangle single no it's still there um so it's going to be"
14023300,14027220," pipeline uh-huh pipeline vertex"
14029220,14034340," yeah so maybe that's what i have to import here but it's kind of strange that i have to import that explicitly"
14034340,14036420," uh right you know what i mean"
14039220,14046580," uh still still still not a not a thing still not a thing um okay"
14046580,14055300," draw so it feels like maybe i just retyped the pipeline thing incorrectly"
14055300,14060420," so let me see maybe i missed something in here"
14060420,14066100," uh okay so it feels like i might have actually missed something"
14067060,14071860," right so let me go back and maybe i'm gonna just try to copy paste this entire thing now"
14071860,14075940," now i'm already copy pasting code right so let's remove all of the comments"
14075940,14081940," and maybe then it will be more obvious that i missed something maybe i missed some calls"
14081940,14089700," that could be the thing uh okay so we have a vertex input then that triangle list"
14090740,14100820," viewport dynamic scissors fragment shader render pass okay build uh unwrap and yeah it's literally the same"
14100820,14105060," isn't it it's literally the same thing uh almost"
14105060,14111300," okay well i mean i can try to comment it out but it's still"
14112500,14120020," uh no still doesn't work um okay maybe it has something to do maybe it's not about single buffer but"
14120020,14127140," it's about like um cpu accessible buffer"
14127140,14136260," um did you put clone on your vertex i remember uh you did default and debug"
14137460,14137940," ah"
14137940,14143380," holy"
14143380,14143620," shit"
14143620,14147380," how did you notice that"
14147380,14158820," okay so no it didn't really help but that's a good point uh that's a good point"
14160340,14166100," um so vertex so yeah default clone and something something"
14166100,14173140," well i mean besides the point how did you notice that because i completely forgot about it like uh"
14173140,14178980," yeah but you do remember how do you do that every time holy shit you're so good at programming way"
14178980,14186180," better than um all right so there's something wrong in here uh maybe i just have to continue"
14187220,14195300," okay let's just try to continue uh maybe then later it feels like i just need to import some of the"
14195300,14199780," things like in terms of imports you know what i mean"
14199780,14203700," uh because some of the imports like are required here"
14203700,14211700," i'm pretty sure if i just take all of my imports right and replace them with the imports from the"
14211700,14217380," tutorial this will just work i'm pretty sure it's just something about the imports"
14217380,14223140," yeah and this one is something like this"
14223140,14230900," no it's not that oh that is so interesting"
14231620,14235460," okay okay okay okay okay okay so that maybe maybe there is a hope"
14235460,14240580," so maybe we still don't have enough information to derive the types"
14240580,14244420," you know what i'm talking about maybe we still don't have enough information"
14244420,14253540," um i don't know let's just continue let's just keep believing that at the end it will just work"
14253540,14259300," magically and everyone is well i mean this should be enough information right do we use pipeline"
14259300,14271300," anywhere else uh pipeline okay so this pipeline is used uh there's too much pipeline here and that's"
14271300,14279220," the only place where it's used seriously that's that's the last place uh but maybe because of the builder"
14280980,14284820," it's going to have like a different type and something oh my god i don't i don't even know"
14284820,14294660," it's something specifically about the pipeline"
14306820,14311700," builder okay so this is the command buffer"
14311700,14318660," all right"
14318660,14322980," so maybe i'm going to do something like this"
14322980,14334820," okay still still doesn't do it still doesn't do it"
14334820,14340180," all right"
14340180,14342740," all right so"
14342740,14349460," okay let's i i really don't want to continue until i fix it because it doesn't make any sense this is"
14349460,14351860," really like holy"
14351860,14356820," let's pipeline"
14356820,14363860," it's literally the same"
14363860,14367700," it's literally the same it's not from the imports"
14372580,14385380," it's not from the imports i'm only streaming for four hours by the way"
14385380,14389700," does i have any questions maybe i need to make a small break"
14389700,14394660," any questions ask me something please because uh my brain is just too"
14395780,14402340," to caught up on this uh bullshit so just just ask me something please um"
14402340,14412900," i probably need to make another cup of tea okay whatever"
14417140,14418180," do you like toasts"
14418180,14418340," do you like toasts no"
14418340,14423780," is p stored in balls yes"
14423780,14426820," um"
14426820,14433380," okay thank you for the question uh really appreciate them"
14441620,14445380," the p is stored in shaders that's for sure"
14445380,14455380," thank you for the questions really appreciate them they helped me a lot"
14464980,14470820," all right we're almost there um but i still don't cry this time maybe we need to"
14470820,14475940," google up something so maybe i need to read into the error"
14475940,14480660," um so the following implementations were found"
14488260,14491540," trade bound single buffer is not satisfied"
14491540,14498020," single buffer definition is not implemented um for vertex source"
14498020,14505220," for vertex source uh okay so and it happens somewhere"
14505220,14508820," vertex buffer"
14508820,14512820," oh the problem is actually with this thing"
14512820,14515060," okay"
14517460,14531460," um"
14531460,14544980," do you see the difference"
14547460,14549700," chat do you see the difference"
14549700,14553460," i swear to god"
14553460,14561460," i'm afraid to go there and press a single d"
14561460,14572660," and then people get mad at me when i complain about this language"
14573860,14576740," like they legit get mad at me when i complain about it"
14576740,14585140," is it like i'm being unfair i'm just doing something wrong i didn't read"
14585140,14587380," documentation blah blah blah all of these things"
14587940,14599620," and that's why i'm just saying i'm just saying anything because i'm just showing you because"
14599620,14602020," i'm just showing you because saying anything is pointless i'm just showing you"
14602740,14611220," uh so i just i just let the the code speak for itself i'm not saying anything um okay so let's give it a"
14611220,14624100," try uh i'll give it a try uh let's give it a try"
14624100,14624500," uh"
14624500,14624500," i'll give it a try"
14624500,14624900," uh"
14624900,14624900," i'll give it a try"
14624900,14625220," um"
14625220,14639220," uh"
14639220,14639220," uh"
14639220,14639220," uh"
14639220,14639220," uh"
14639220,14639220," uh"
14639220,14639220," uh"
14639220,14639220," uh"
14639220,14653300," why is he good manning it i'm not mad this is a good language what are you guys talking about"
14653300,14672740," uh it's perfect like in all the ways like i absolutely love it i think it's very very good"
14673380,14682660," like uh yeah it is very very good language why would i be mad at it i really enjoy my time right"
14682660,14691780," now like i really enjoy programming um okay so everything seems to be compiling um and uh uh yeah"
14691780,14692260," let's see"
14692260,14696740," uh"
14696740,14707860," okay"
14707860,14715860," so then we do this previous frame thingy so it's going to take"
14715860,14721540," and to be fair i don't know how to work with features so then"
14722260,14732180," uh acquire future and i wonder uh where acquire future comes from"
14732180,14740820," so it could be actually oh yeah okay so we acquired the image from the swap chain and that"
14740820,14749060," give us the future and um okay okay i think that makes sense uh then execute"
14751060,14757380," so provide the cure like okay so now i understand why we clone these things all the time"
14757380,14761620," uh but it still messes up with my brain because i got used to when you clone this thing"
14761620,14770260," you create a copy of an object right so oh oh oh now"
14770260,14780420," i was always thinking how do you implement reference counting in rust how do you do reference"
14780420,14785540," counting in rust where you have this borrow checker model and stuff like that where like how can you"
14785540,14790740," make a reference to the same thing from different places like borrow checker just won't allow you to"
14790740,14799140," do that it's a hack it's a hack so they created arc object that treats borrow checker into thinking"
14799140,14803460," that you're cloning an object but in fact you're not oh my god"
14806500,14818660," holy this is such a good link this is genius this is such a cool idea i really like it"
14832740,14838020," the more i explore this language the more i actually start this is absolutely genius"
14838020,14847940," oh my god that is so cool um this is very very cool it's just like yeah like how can we have reference"
14847940,14853140," counter in a language that on the semantic level fundamentally does not allow us to have reference"
14853140,14862180," the more to have reference to the other objects that we have reference to the other objects that is so cool"
14862180,14866020," um okay"
14866020,14882180," so um it's going to be unwrap uh okay so this is the future and then then swap chain present okay uh"
14883140,14894260," huh then swap chain present q clone swap chain clone it still messes up with my brain"
14894260,14899540," uh it really messes up with my brain because it's a clone"
14899540,14904100," why do we making so many copies why do we make so many copies we're not making copies"
14904820,14915140," uh all right so this is not copies uh signal fans and flush okay so cool uh can we just try to build"
14915140,14921140," this entire thing and um yeah all righty"
14924100,14931540," um"
14931540,14952340," all right so after that we take a look at the future and if it went okay we just store it as a previous"
14952340,14957940," feature okay um"
14957940,14977940," okay"
14981540,14988660," so what does it do true does it do trick i don't understand what you're trying to say i'm sorry"
14988660,14995860," uh how does it work how does it do that i think uh you're copying it's the same way how shared"
14995860,15000180," point of works i think i think it's literally the same when you're copying you're not copying"
15000180,15005540," the object itself you're copying the object that stores the pointer to that object plus"
15005540,15012580," a reference to the global state that increments like uh the value in a global table or something"
15012580,15019460," like that i think it's literally like shared point or something but there's also rc i i don't like i"
15019460,15024420," don't really know much about russ so i might not know that but i think this is how it works so there's"
15024420,15033220," arc uh a thread saves and i think just rc is not thread safe right a single threaded okay so they're"
15033220,15037140," pretty much the same but the one is a single threaded another one is not single thing okay"
15037140,15042500," uh i think the ref count is stored alongside the inner object on the heap"
15043300,15057300," um the inner object on the heap ah ah i see so the lookup is of one right so essentially you know the"
15057300,15061460," pointer and with all of one you can instantly look up the how many reference you have okay"
15061460,15068180," so that makes sense maybe maybe before the object or after the or something like that yeah okay that makes"
15068180,15086900," sense and also you know it's probably good for the cache right so you don't jump between some sort of"
15086900,15104900," table and the object itself so so i think the actual analog of uh shared pointer in c plus plus will be rc"
15104900,15112820," right it's like just a regular one but with yeah but single thread"
15116900,15123620," okay okay okay go"
15123620,15137540," interesting interesting shared pointer as atomic oh okay so that means our arc is literally the analog of"
15137540,15146420," shared pointer sure um okay so previous frame and some uh future boxed"
15147140,15159380," some future box there we go uh flushed error out of date if something like this happened we recreate swap chain"
15159380,15176260," Intro. Yeah, that's probably what we need to do in here."
15182900,15190900," ""fail to flush future"". I wonder if we may end up with a situation where this will be printed on each"
15190900,15195860," iteration of event and it's gonna actually absolutely destroy the output of the program."
15195860,15198820," ""fail to flush future""."
15205780,15212180," Chad, look! It's a ASCII version of Tzodding Clown, but on the side, 90 degrees."
15212180,15230420," Sorry. Previous frame and some sync."
15230420,15237940," I'm sorry."
15237940,15242340," Okay, I guess that's it. That's the end."
15242340,15244660," We'll listen to our stuff."
15244660,15250900," And so this is roughly 326 lines of ""could""."
15250900,15253860," A ""could""."
15253860,15262420," We're just waiting for the compilation."
15262420,15264420," All right, so we have a couple of warnings."
15264420,15265060," Let me take a look."
15265060,15272740," We don't have a render pass."
15272740,15274740," We're just waiting for the compilation."
15274740,15278100," All right, so we have a couple of warnings."
15278100,15279140," Let me take a look."
15279140,15281620," We don't have a render pass."
15281620,15283620," ""Rulcon""."
15283620,15285620," Why do you call it ""rulcon""?"
15285620,15286580," ""Rulcon""."
15286580,15288660," Oh, it's a good look who suggested to call it like that."
15288660,15295300," ""Rulcon""."
15295300,15300340," It's a little flushed."
15300340,15308180," Okay, so what do we got?"
15308180,15309540," What do we got?"
15312100,15312980," One more time."
15312980,15314980," I just want to compile it without any warnings."
15314980,15319140," I just want to compile it without any warnings."
15319140,15320420," Warnings."
15320420,15326980," I just want to make sure that it compiles without any warnings."
15326980,15330500," And we're going to try to run it for the first time."
15330500,15334100," Try to witness the glory of the triangle."
15334100,15337220," Or the glory of the black screen."
15337220,15337780," Who knows?"
15337780,15341460," It just depends on what we can see."
15341460,15342740," So are you guys ready?"
15342740,15344500," Are you guys ready?"
15344500,15346660," We're going to witness the triangle after..."
15346660,15348020," Wait a second."
15348020,15350500," 4 hours and 15 minutes."
15350500,15352820," After 4 hours and 15 minutes of work,"
15352820,15356020," we're about to witness the triangle."
15356020,15358020," Maybe for the first time."
15358020,15359940," Are you ready?"
15359940,15360500," Are you ready?"
15360500,15370100," Holy fucking shit."
15370100,15374180," Here it is."
15374180,15376340," Here is the fucking triangle."
15376340,15378980," Yes."
15378980,15381620," Here it fucking is."
15383380,15384260," Isn't that amazing?"
15384260,15386420," We could get them fucking amazing."
15386420,15388020," I'm going to fucking cry."
15388020,15390980," It's so fucking beautiful."
15390980,15393940," 4 hours of work."
15393940,15402260," 4 hours of work."
15402260,15403780," And finally."
15403780,15405700," We've got a triangle."
15411060,15412260," Now that's some achievement."
15412260,15418180," That's the future of software development."
15418180,15419780," Right in front."
15419780,15421300," You see?"
15421300,15422980," Absolutely."
15422980,15424900," Astonishing."
15424900,15427860," And that is available for everyone."
15427860,15431060," Anyone can just download Vulcan and Rust."
15431060,15434740," And just make the same thing on their computer."
15434740,15436980," And it's absolutely safe."
15436980,15439300," It's absolutely safe."
15439300,15440500," It's not going to hurt anymore."
15440500,15446100," So can we actually make it rainbowish triangle?"
15446100,15447620," Kappa-priot triangle."
15447620,15449540," We need to make it Kappa-priot triangle."
15449540,15454420," So the easiest way to do it Kappa-priot triangle is"
15454420,15461300," actually pass color information along with the vertices."
15461300,15461540," Right?"
15461540,15464420," But I have no idea how to do that."
15464420,15466820," So that's a huge problem."
15467940,15477780," So I think we can try to do this thing on the level of the shaders."
15477780,15482660," So in JLSL, as far as I know, we have a thing called JL Vertex ID."
15482660,15490820," So that means we can distinguish between different vertices on the level of a shader."
15491540,15497220," So basically, I think we can have something like output somewhere here in the vertex shader."
15497220,15498740," Let's actually put something like this."
15499700,15504420," So it's going to be out vec4 vertex color."
15504420,15512180," And then in here, we're going to have the input, right?"
15512180,15516180," We're going to have some sort of input as the vertex color."
15519300,15525060," So what we're going to do in here, depending on the vertex ID, we're going to set the color either to..."
15525060,15526340," Yeah."
15526340,15530500," So essentially, if it's zero, I want the color to be red."
15530500,15532420," If it's one, I want it to be green."
15532420,15536180," If it's two, I want it to be blue."
15536180,15540660," So the easiest way to do that would be to probably create some sort of an array."
15540660,15546420," And we're using the latest JLSL, like 4.5 something something."
15546420,15550820," So that means we should have all of the perks of this JLSL, right?"
15550820,15552980," JLSL arrays."
15552980,15554100," So how do I do arrays?"
15554100,15567540," So I just need an example on how to do arrays."
15567540,15575380," *Sweezling*"
15575380,15578340," ""Sweezling""."
15578340,15580660," I don't know what that word means, but I really like it for some reason."
15580660,15582180," Arrays."
15582180,15583140," So we have arrays."
15583140,15587540," I guess I can just do it like that, I suppose."
15587540,15590580," Yeah."
15590580,15592260," Well, okay."
15595220,15599620," Well, I mean, you can always just do ifs, but nobody likes ifs, right?"
15599620,15607780," So vec4 colors, and we're going to have three of them, right?"
15607780,15608980," So we're going to have three colors."
15608980,15612260," And keep forgetting how we initialize them."
15612260,15616580," It's so difficult to find any examples."
15616580,15618820," Array initialization."
15618820,15622900," It's like with the component reversed."
15623620,15623860," Okay."
15623860,15628500," It's just so difficult to, and it doesn't make much sense."
15628500,15630420," I remember having troubles."
15630420,15635380," ""JLSL array initialization""."
15635380,15635700," Okay."
15635700,15643140," So yeah, it's kind of like with these things, but if I have a vector, how do I do that?"
15644820,15647460," So it's probably going to be like vec this."
15647460,15650260," And this is what I want to have here, right?"
15650260,15660500," So zero has to be vec4, 1, 0, 0, 1, right?"
15660500,15666740," So then it's going to be like this, it's going to be that, and this is going to be another one, right?"
15666740,15668340," So this is basically what I want to have."
15668340,15669860," Is that a correct way of doing that?"
15669860,15670260," I don't know."
15670260,15671460," Maybe."
15671460,15672020," Who knows?"
15672020,15680820," And vertex color is going to be equal colors based on gl vertex ID, right?"
15680820,15682740," So this is basically what we're going to have in here."
15684020,15689700," And essentially, we're going to assign the output color to the vertex color."
15689700,15691380," Let's see what's going to happen."
15691380,15693620," So in theory, this is what I want to have."
15693620,15696900," But I'm sure if I'm going to get it."
15696900,15697300," We'll see."
15697300,15699700," Of course, it doesn't compile."
15699700,15700100," Of course."
15701140,15704900," So, and location requires..."
15704900,15714420," What do you want for me?"
15714420,15715620," I don't know."
15715620,15717620," That's what I'm talking about."
15717620,15722100," Like it's really unclear what it wants for me because it just works."
15722100,15725060," And why does it say anything about location?"
15725060,15726420," Because it worked before."
15731140,15736100," Ah, you think so?"
15736100,15737700," It requires explicit location?"
15737700,15738020," Okay."
15738020,15740420," So if..."
15740420,15742100," Okay."
15742100,15746820," So I can put a layout location one."
15746820,15750180," But it was complaining about..."
15750180,15752580," It was complaining about vertex, right?"
15752580,15756900," So, and in probably also requires explicit location."
15756900,15758660," So we're going to put it like one."
15758660,15759060," Oh, yeah."
15759060,15762100," So that means if it's an explicit location,"
15762100,15764340," it doesn't depend on the names of the variables anymore."
15764340,15765540," You can name it however you want."
15765540,15765860," Okay."
15765860,15768180," That's cool."
15768180,15773860," And what do we have in here?"
15773860,15776580," An expected right parent."
15776580,15781380," And this is what I'm talking about."
15781380,15783780," So the arrays are probably initialized incorrectly here."
15785300,15792340," So, to initialize, to initialize, initialize array."
15792340,15796900," Okay."
15796900,15802260," Oh, it has to be, it has to, it doesn't have to be three."
15812100,15813700," So, uh, twelve."
15813700,15815700," Oh!"
15815700,15818260," It's one of those languages, right?"
15818260,15828020," Undeclared identifier."
15828020,15831860," Wait, did they rename it?"
15831860,15835780," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15835780,15837140," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15837140,15838180," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15838180,15839460," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15839460,15840260," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15840260,15840980," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15840980,15842260," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15842260,15842740," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15842740,15843460," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15843460,15844180," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15844180,15845220," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15845220,15846020," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15846020,15847140," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15847140,15848180," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15848180,15849140," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15849140,15850260," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15850260,15851140," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15851140,15851940," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15851940,15853140," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15853140,15854260," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15861860,15872820," Oh, it's one of those languages."
15872820,15875300," Okay, so let's try to do an index then."
15875300,15877220," I don't mind."
15877220,15891620," As long as it's going to work."
15891620,15903140," Okay."
15907220,15909780," Holy fucking shit."
15909780,15912180," Now we're fucking talking."
15912180,15913700," Oh my God."
15913700,15915140," Yes, cup of pride."
15915140,15916660," Cup of pride."
15916660,15919060," My God."
15919060,15921860," It's absolutely beautiful."
15921860,15928660," After four and half of an hour,"
15928660,15930900," this is what we achieved."
15930900,15934100," We not only went through the entire tutorial,"
15934100,15936900," we went beyond the tutorial."
15937460,15937700," Right."
15937700,15939780," Because tutorial didn't show you how to do the shit."
15939780,15940260," No, no, no."
15940260,15941060," They didn't show you."
15941060,15943620," They just threw some bullshit at you."
15943620,15944660," We managed to do that."
15944660,15946500," Isn't that amazing?"
15946500,15947860," Isn't that amazing?"
15947860,15949620," I think it's going to be fucking amazing."
15949620,15951780," So we extended the tutorial."
15951780,15960100," Absolutely fucking unbelievable."
15960100,15963300," All right."
15963300,15966420," So let me do the following thing."
15966420,15968180," I think it's worth committing."
15968180,15969940," I think this entire shit worth committing."
15969940,15972580," So let me..."
15972580,15973540," Do I have a readme?"
15973540,15974980," I don't even have a readme."
15974980,15976580," But yeah."
15976580,15979460," So let me see."
15979460,15981060," So this is going to be a project."
15981060,15982340," This is going to be a project."
15982340,15986260," And let me copy this entire stuff in here."
15986260,15991540," So it's going to be PWD based on this thing."
15991540,15993140," It's literally based on this thing."
15993140,15996420," The license that we're going to use."
15996420,15997940," So let me remove all this stuff."
16000980,16002340," I'm going to put MIT in here."
16002340,16006900," That's a good idea."
16006900,16009060," Maybe I'm going to make a screenshot and put it to readme."
16009060,16014420," Readme."
16017860,16019700," So I think I want to call it slightly differently."
16019700,16024980," Because this project does not represent what I'm actually doing."
16024980,16026420," Vulcan."
16026420,16028260," Vulcano."
16028260,16032100," Rainbow triangle."
16032100,16034820," Rainbow triangle."
16034820,16036260," Vulcano rainbow triangle."
16039380,16049460," So okay."
16049460,16053540," Classical."
16053540,16058580," Rainbow triangle."
16058580,16064020," Using rust and vulcan."
16064900,16071540," via the vulcano bindings."
16071540,16072340," Right."
16072340,16074820," All right."
16074820,16077620," So let me find the vulcano bindings."
16077620,16080100," I think this is where they are."
16080100,16086820," So."
16086820,16088660," Based."
16088660,16092580," On the vulcano."
16093620,16095140," triangle example."
16095140,16096100," Right."
16096100,16098180," It's a vulcano triangle example."
16098180,16099060," And."
16099060,16102020," We can put this thing in here."
16102020,16103620," Then."
16103620,16105700," We're going to do it like that."
16105700,16106500," It's going to be quick."
16106500,16107860," Start."
16107860,16109700," Console."
16109700,16112180," And it's going to be just cargo."
16112180,16114020," Cargo run."
16114020,16115780," You see how easy it is?"
16115780,16117540," You see how easy it is?"
16117540,16119060," It's just cargo run."
16119060,16121060," You don't have to set up anything."
16121060,16122020," It's just cargo run."
16122660,16123380," All the way through."
16123380,16124340," All right."
16124340,16124660," So."
16124660,16126340," Let me."
16126340,16127860," Let me try to run that one more time."
16127860,16134980," So."
16134980,16136500," You just do cargo run."
16136500,16138180," And after a couple of hours."
16138180,16139940," You have yourself a rainbow triangle."
16139940,16141860," It's that simple."
16141860,16142180," Okay."
16142180,16144340," It's that fucking simple."
16147380,16148900," Even if you have all of the."
16148900,16149860," All of the dependencies."
16149860,16150420," Compiling."
16150420,16150980," Compiled."
16150980,16152260," You still have to wait."
16152260,16154180," For whatever fucking reason."
16154180,16156020," I still don't understand why."
16156020,16157620," Okay."
16157620,16157860," So."
16157860,16159300," Oh yeah."
16159300,16160500," When I'm reciting everything."
16160500,16162100," Yeah."
16162100,16163380," Wait a second."
16166820,16167620," Script."
16167620,16167620," Script."
16167620,16167620," Script."
16167620,16167620," Script."
16167620,16168020," S."
16168020,16169220," Uh-huh."
16169220,16173380," And I'm going to put it like that."
16173380,16178100," Okay."
16178100,16180420," So I'm going to move this thing here."
16180420,16185780," Thumbnail."
16187860,16189380," And uh."
16189380,16189620," Yep."
16189620,16190660," Thumbnail."
16190660,16192020," Thumbnail."
16192020,16193860," Thumbnail."
16193860,16195940," PMG."
16195940,16196340," Okay."
16196340,16197780," Uh."
16197780,16198020," Also."
16198020,16199700," I think I need to update the."
16199700,16200980," Name."
16200980,16201860," Um."
16201860,16202820," Right."
16202820,16203540," It has to be."
16203540,16205940," Something like this."
16205940,16207940," I wonder if updating the name of the project."
16207940,16210420," Will trigger the whole recompilation of the project."
16217860,16219060," It has to be."
16219060,16220180," There's a lot of people who have to do it."
16220180,16221140," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16221140,16222260," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16222260,16223140," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16223140,16223780," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16223780,16224180," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16224180,16224660," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16224660,16225940," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16225940,16227140," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16227140,16227620," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16227620,16228340," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16228340,16229060," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16229060,16229540," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16229540,16230580," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16230580,16231060," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16231060,16232180," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16232180,16242500," There's a lot of people who have to be."
16242500,16249140," Okay, we didn't recompile everything, which is nice."
16249140,16254740," Do we have any rule come?"
16254740,16255460," I don't think so."
16255460,16258980," All right, so let me let me try that."
16261620,16264580," So if I take a look at the log, how many share do we have?"
16264580,16266020," Thousand lines."
16266020,16269860," Ready, set, go."
16269860,16272100," Even though we're programming in Rust."
16272100,16275140," Okay."
16275140,16276660," Wait."
16276660,16278100," Okay."
16278100,16280020," It's gonna be Zozin."
16280020,16284660," More lines for Kargo."
16284660,16289060," But it costs nothing."
16289700,16293620," Adding a dependency to Kargo literally costs nothing."
16293620,16294900," It's that easy."
16294900,16297140," Why wouldn't you do that?"
16297140,16299300," It's that fucking easy."
16299300,16300420," Holy fucking shit."
16300420,16301300," It's literally free."
16302100,16303220," Okay."
16303220,16303220," Okay."
16303220,16306020," So let me let me try to do this thing."
16306020,16313300," Sounds good."
16313300,16313700," Public."
16313700,16319940," Classical rubber triangle using Rust and Vulcan via Vulcan bindings."
16319940,16335540," And let's just do that."
16343940,16344260," Okay."
16344260,16346980," Hope it wasn't too loud."
16346980,16350900," All right."
16350900,16354500," So this is the result of today's stream."
16354500,16356420," Give it a try."
16356420,16358020," Try to compile it on your machine."
16358020,16361300," Send me your electrical bill afterwards."
16365460,16367860," So anyway."
16367860,16372500," So that's pretty cool."
16372500,16375060," I guess we managed to do something."
16375060,16377540," Vulcan, a rainbow triangle and stuff like that."
16377540,16379140," Yeah."
16384020,16385300," I guess that's it for today."
16385300,16388660," I hope today's stream was interesting for somebody."
16388660,16393620," People were asking me to do Vulcan and Rust stream for quite some time."
16393620,16395860," And there you go."
16395860,16396420," I did it."
16396420,16398180," I guess happy now?"
16398180,16400100," Is everyone happy now?"
16400100,16401300," I did the thing."
16401300,16403140," I did the Vulcan and Rust thing."
16404580,16406580," So maybe it was fun."
16406580,16407220," Maybe it was not."
16407220,16407620," I don't know."
16407620,16410820," In any case, I gotta go."
16410820,16413460," Thanks everyone who's watching me right now."
16413460,16414660," I really appreciate it."
16414660,16415460," Have a good one."
16415460,16417540," And I see you all tomorrow."
16417540,16422340," Tomorrow we're going to be doing game development in C++ and OpenGL."
16422340,16424580," So yeah."
16424580,16426500," Check out our schedule."
16426500,16428500," Check out our VOTS channel."
16428500,16431140," This stream is definitely going to be on the VOTS channel."
16431140,16434340," Because I need this stream to be on the VOTS channel."
16434340,16436580," Every time somebody asks me about Rust and Vulcan."
16436580,16437780," There you go."
16437780,16438260," I did it."
16438260,16440260," May I go in peace now."
16440260,16440980," Thank you very much."
16440980,16445380," And also check out our Discord server for offline discussion with the community."
16445380,16447060," And let's maybe raise somebody."
16447060,16454180," Is anyone streaming any Vulcan and Rust on the science and technology section of the Twitch platform?"
16454180,16456100," Is anyone doing that?"
16456100,16458740," So let's see."
16458740,16459220," Let's see."
16464340,16465540," Let's see."
16465540,16468580," Fortf is doing something."
16468580,16470740," Fortf is doing."
16470740,16472900," So he's doing Elm."
16472900,16475940," But we're not doing function."
16475940,16478180," Well, I mean, we're technically doing function programming."
16478180,16479220," But I don't know."
16479220,16480980," Strawberry Hacker is probably doing something cool."
16480980,16482820," Making compiler."
16482820,16485620," Tokenizer and compiling expressions."
16487540,16488740," Let's raise Strawberry Hacker."
16488740,16491780," I think he's doing some interesting stuff."
16491780,16492260," Quite often."
16492260,16494100," All right."
16494100,16497300," So I'm going to copy paste his nickname."
16497300,16498340," And yeah."
16498340,16499140," Day one."
16499140,16500340," Yes, yes, yes."
16500340,16501140," Go away this."
16502900,16503220," All right."
16503220,16509460," Say hi to Strawberry Hacker."
16509460,16511700," Get ready for the writ."
16511700,16514500," Get ready for the writ."
16514500,16516500," And I see you all tomorrow."
16516500,16517220," Love you all."
16532900,16562880," Thank you."
