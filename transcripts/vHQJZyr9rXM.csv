960,6400," looks like we're live hello everyone and welcome to yet another azuzin session"
6400,12320," let's make a little bit of an announcement and officially start the stream maybe maybe how about"
12320,22880," that uh so uh red uh circle live on twitch and what are we doing today on twitch.a television"
22880,32640," website today we are doing html5 canvas based ui in typescript that's right this channel is slowly"
32640,37680," descending into madness and we're becoming a web development channel that's what we're becoming"
37680,42320," today i'm going to give the link to the place where we're doing all that which.tv/todding and"
42320,47360," i'm going to ping everyone who's interested in being pinged there we go the stream has officially"
47360,53280," started so today we're going to continue uh working on outer cell basically like a small"
53280,58160," cellular automaton experiment that's been going on for several streams already so it doesn't really"
58160,62640," sound that small but the reason why it's going on for so long is because we're using web technologies"
62640,66480," if i just wrote it in c it would have been faster because it wouldn't have to deal with a lot of"
66480,74320," bullshit though um today we're going to continue dealing with uh right so essentially the idea is"
74320,81360," that we have a representation of a cellular automaton right and we are trying to take a pixel art image"
81360,87440," and turn the information within the pixel art image and the information about the neighbors between the"
87440,93440," cells and stuff like that into a cell or automaton and see what kind of interesting behavior that may"
93440,98720," exhibit right nothing particularly special uh right i'm not even sure if we're going to end up with any"
98720,103600," interesting result but developing this thing is kind of interesting nonetheless right you can find this"
103600,109760," uh the source code of this entire thing here uh right so i'm gonna uh copy paste it in the chat and"
109760,114000," for people who potentially watching that on youtube you will be able to find it in the description already"
114000,120400," put in the description uh all right so uh so right now we have something like this right so here is"
120400,126640," a pixel art image uh not by me right we stole it from the open game art and essentially uh what kind of"
126640,131760," what kind of cell automaton we constructed out of that is basically we took each individual pixel in"
131760,140720," here and uh for the frequencies of its new moore neighborhood uh we created a state that basically refers to"
140720,147600," itself so that way when you take an image and put it on the board uh this entire thing uh stays stable"
147600,155760," uh right uh it it stays stable uh and uh won't uh you know fall apart or anything unless you actually"
155760,160160," replace one of the pixels as soon as you replace one of the pixels with for instance dead pixels or"
160160,165040," background pixels the entire thing falls apart because this entire structure doesn't hold anymore"
165040,171680," right because we constructed a cell automaton based on the frequencies of uh known pixels uh right and"
171680,175760," it's kind of cool actually you can play with this entire thing right so i'm gonna copy paste it in here"
175760,181200," in here right but you have to refresh the page if you want to uh like you know uh refresh this and"
181200,184880," test stuff it's kind of silly but it's kind of interesting nonetheless it's all right it creates"
184880,193280," an interesting effect uh right so yeah that's pretty cool i think so there's sort of like a falling apart"
193280,201920," uh so essentially uh what i wanted to do today um we have uh different states in the image so"
201920,208160," essentially the way we work we take an image and we analyze the unique pixels in that specific image"
208160,213840," right unique pixels in that specific image and the amount of unique pixels is the amount of states of"
213840,220880," that specific cellular automaton right so uh and then we have sort of like a palette in here that allows"
220880,228160," us to draw uh different cells of different states but unfortunately as of right now the amount of states for"
228160,232960," that cellular automaton is hard-coded right so you can only have dead and alive it comes from"
232960,238000," the time when we were experimenting with just like things like go uh game of life and stuff like that"
238000,243600," so all of that is hard-coded but depending on the cellular automaton you can actually have different states"
243600,248400," and i would like to reflect that somehow so essentially depending on the current cellular automaton i want to"
248400,255360," have like different things in here but also since we are working with colors now right as you can see"
255360,262720," there these are colors and there is no notion of dead cell a live cell there is red cell there is blue cell"
262720,268720," and so on and so forth and all the states are computed uh automatically based on the image uh like having"
268720,274640," names in here is not particularly useful right so they don't really tell us much so what i would like to"
274640,281040," have instead is actually something like a palette uh right similar to the palette you have like in my"
281040,286480," paint right so there are different palettes in here um so this particular palette is actually"
286480,294960," and not uh kind of great so there is a color palette yeah i would like to have something like that"
294960,302720," right so it would be kind of cool if we had something like that here on the side and uh basically we had as"
302720,308320," many of these colors in here as there are states in this specific cellular automaton so you can pick one"
308320,314480," and actually place it in here and stuff like that so i can already place some stuff in here but it's a"
314480,320960," like a i'm not sure if you can see that right but it's like a black color which is not background so"
320960,325360," it's a little bit darker than the the actual background right and if i play it it just falls apart"
325360,331040," uh all right so i want to have something like this but then how do i even code"
331600,338800," a palette like that right how do i represent it in the uh in the html and stuff like that because i'm"
338800,344880," not a web developer right i'm not a web developer i don't want to deal with the css or html5 and stuff"
344880,352960," like that but then i realized right i'm a you know low level c programmer right and how low level c"
352960,358960," programmers do graphics how do they do graphics they just have an array of pixels and they just fill up the"
358960,369200," the array of pixels that sounds like a job for html5 canvas why not just uh create a single html5 canvas"
369200,373840," which is going to be an element that implements this specific palette"
373840,383120," so yeah that's the idea for today's stream right i want to implement a sort of like a widget which is a"
383120,391360," single uh html5 canvas and it implements behavior of this palette right it is going to basically accept"
391360,398400," the amount of states right and then each individual core of the state uh right and it will just like draw"
398400,404880," them and it will handle the clicks on the canvas uh and it will highlight the currently selected color"
404880,408880," and it will allow you to switch between them and stuff like that so it's sort of like a palette"
408880,415040," uh color picker right but we're not we cannot use a color picker because we're not selecting colors"
415040,423360," that's the thing this is not a color picker we're not selecting colors we have we selecting states of a"
423360,432720," cellular automaton and each state has an associated color but we're not picking the color color is just a label"
433520,439840," on the state does it make sense right so we're not really dealing with colors uh colors are"
439840,445920," specifically for a human being to make sense out of the state of the board of the cellular automaton"
445920,451040," right so the cell automaton doesn't care about the colors at all it doesn't even know about them"
451040,457040," honestly it really doesn't know about them so as far as the cell automaton concerned it has states"
457040,464640," zero one two three four five six and so on and so forth right so it even in memory it stores the states"
464640,472480," as the numbers right and then somewhere in a separate place we have a table that associates okay the state"
472480,480160," zero is a transparent one the state one is the black one the state two is a red one and when we're rendering"
480160,486640," the state of the board we're mapping the numbers of the states to these scores right so because of"
486640,490560," that it's not particularly color picker but we're still going to make it look like a palette because"
490560,496640," that's uh that's what we as humans can interpret does it make sense hopefully hopefully that makes sense"
496640,503120," so and uh depending on the current cell automaton the the palette is going to change right so because"
503120,507440," it's going to have different states and uh correspondingly it's going to have different colors and stuff like"
507440,517200," yeah so that's the that's the view for the stream so hopefully i explained that well so let's acknowledge"
517200,523600," some subs uh thank you so much uh my c14 for uh twitch prime subscription it was actually when i was"
523600,529280," offline but thank you thank you thank you and thank you so much my cq for uh twitch prime subscription seven"
529280,536240," minutes ago i really appreciate the twitch prime a subscription okay so let's go how about that how about"
536240,549440," that we are html programmers now yes html programmers so let me take a look so we have uh div controls by"
549440,557520," the way this project is the first time i ever used flexbox i never actually used flexbox before and it's"
557520,567680," actually kind of convenient right so if we take a look at the css uh right so yeah i said display flex"
567680,574400," on a class canvas with controls let's actually take a look at this class yeah so basically whatever i put"
574400,581760," in here is going to be uh arranged horizontally that's basically what it means right so it's arranged"
581760,587360," horizontally so the first thing that is arranged here is the canvas itself right it's uh this thing"
587520,593280," uh let's wait for uh let's wait for the how is it called devtools right so this is the first thing"
593280,598640," and then the next thing is the panel in here so that's how it basically works it's actually controls"
598640,604080," in here right so this is actually controls and this is here this is where we have like a field"
604640,615360," set and then the uh the rest of the stuff so i suppose for now i'm going to uh i'm going to place uh another"
615360,624720," canvas in here so this is going to be a canvas and uh what this canvas is going to be uh let's call it palette"
624720,632720," uh palette how do you spell palette i don't remember is it double l or double t i can never remember if"
632720,635680," it's double l or double t freaking"
635680,641040," just give me the right answer right"
641040,645920," okay thank you that's what that's what i care about"
645920,652320," all right so uh we've got some subs would you look at this would you look at that thank you so much"
652320,657920," matt kruger for uh twitch fans description thank you thank you thank you with the message html is poggers"
657920,660640," html is the best programming language yes"
660640,667600," uh yeah it stands for hyper transformative machine learning"
667600,677600," ah that's what it said did you know that html stands for hyper transformative machine learning so"
679920,686960," it's a machine learning language uh anyways so uh we created a canvas uh yes it's a double t"
686960,698080," i already forgot uh so and uh what i want to do in here right so what's the width of the uh of the"
698080,705920," page in our specific case i think it was uh i said it to something like yeah 960. so the the entire width is"
705920,715360," 960 and i set the width of the canvas if i go to ts in here the width of the canvas to 800. so that means"
715360,726800," uh we only have uh around 160 160 160 for the for the palette right and maybe this is exactly what we're"
726800,733200," gonna set to but i want to have some sort of a padding so maybe because of that it's going to be 150 right so"
733200,741760," that's the idea uh sort of speak um so let's go ahead and just introduce palette id so this is going"
741760,749200," to be palette so i'm just going to be searching it within the uh dome so document get element by id"
749200,760320," palette id as html canvas element there we go and this one is going to be palette so this is the node if"
761760,773280," palette is no i'm going to be throwing an error throw new error uh could not find canvas uh palette id"
773280,789760," uh you know it would be kind of interesting to maybe have a function right uh get element by id or fail right"
790480,797920," so here you accept an id and it usually returns like in case of the get element by id it returns"
797920,804000," just html element or new by the way to indicate that you failed to to get that element we can try to"
804000,810240," maybe return return some sort of like t so you can simultaneously say to what you want to convert"
810240,816800," it to what you want to convert it to right so and also we're not going to be returning null right so there"
816800,824560," would be no um you know or null and in here we're going to just like compress this entire pattern"
824560,829600," because i keep repeating this entire thing over and over again where i just like check for null and throw"
829600,835840," an exception uh maybe it makes sense to actually not do that anymore right so here we have an id uh here we"
835840,842960," provide the id so here we got a node uh or maybe since the official terminology is element right so what's"
842960,848560," called element because we're getting element by id and we're we return html elements so it makes sense"
848560,858800," to call it an element so if elements uh equal no we couldn't find element id like this and otherwise"
858800,866240," we just return something like this right so we do it like that and because of that i can probably compress all"
866240,874800," of this stuff to palette palette uh get element by id or what's called error right so because here we're"
874800,882080," throwing an error right we're just throwing an error uh right so then i provide palette uh then i say"
882080,889440," that i actually want html canvas uh canvas element right until automatically so i don't have to do this"
889440,895920," kind of stuff anymore isn't that epic i think it's pretty freaking epic right so we don't have to care"
895920,900480," about no because it automatically just throws everything for us um not sure how good of an"
900480,908160," idea that is but it may work to some extent uh so let me try to compile this entire thing just to see if"
908160,915360," it you know doesn't fail and stuff like that uh so we're getting some subs we're getting some sub thank"
915360,920160," you so much noran underscore for uh community gifted sub thank you thank you thank you i really appreciate"
920160,929360," it uh so uh let me take a look okay so we are returning oh yeah you're supposed to return t"
929360,933280," so we have to cast it as t there we go"
938080,946000," okay okay that's pretty cool so it compiles and as you know if it compiles what what what what it works"
946000,959360," that's right kappa uh get element uh by id or error html canvas element and we are accepting the app"
959360,966480," uh right so we don't need that we don't need that here we're instantly setting to uh 800 but here we're"
966480,970720," getting the context that we're getting the context that we still need to uh actually uh you know check"
970720,980080," for that we still actually have to check for that so uh here we do next um get element by id or error"
980080,987760," this is next but this is html bottom uh element there we go we don't need that we don't need that"
987760,996000," and i can even just copy paste this thing and just say play uh and then we go so that's pretty cool"
996480,1002400," uh so maybe it makes sense to actually find all of the get elements by id right all the get elements"
1002400,1009200," by id and there we go um all right that's pretty cool i actually want to maybe move it somewhere"
1009200,1013840," outside of this function so it doesn't clutter the current scope there we go"
1017280,1023520," so we've got another sub uh actually uh thank you so much star over for uh t1 subscription thank you"
1023520,1028640," thank you thank you uh without any message but for 25 months oh my god thank you so much for for such a"
1028640,1034880," long support uh and welcome back to our epic web development club we're actually html club right now"
1038880,1046640," we're actually html club all right so let me maybe start the html server all right"
1046640,1055920," you can you can see that i'm not a web developer like what's the i need to start html server guys"
1055920,1059200," like i yes i i'm starting the html server"
1059200,1066880," uh right so i already have it started right so i suppose i already like tested some stuff okay"
1067600,1073040," oh yeah so because i demonstrated this kind of thing in here all right seems to be still working"
1073040,1081600," right so i didn't really break anything right yeah there we go so it works cool very very cool"
1081600,1094320," uh so uh let me find palette so uh let uh so here we have a context right so and i actually just call"
1094320,1102640," it a generic context because i didn't expect that i'm going to uh have uh more than one canvas right"
1102640,1106800," so i actually didn't expect that so maybe because of that i'll have to like use different naming and stuff"
1106800,1117760," uh palette uh ctx palette get context right so this is going to be 2d and if uh palette context is equal to"
1117760,1125520," no right so like this i will have to throw something like this right could not initialize to do context"
1125520,1133760," uh so and in here all right one of the things i probably want to do as already mentioned by the way"
1133760,1142880," is that i want to set the width to this thing to 150 50. right so essentially the entire width of the page is"
1142880,1151040," 960. we used 800 for the canvas for the actual canvas for cellular automaton and we only have 160"
1151040,1155280," for the palette right so i'm going to account for a little bit of a padding if we want to add that"
1155280,1162080," and actually make it 150 right i think it's going to be enough for for now so and after that i'm probably"
1162080,1174960," gonna just like uh surrender feel style so let's actually fill it with the red uh palette ctx feel"
1174960,1187200," erect uh chat chat do you feel erect oh oh i'm sorry uh width uh palette height all right so we're gonna"
1187200,1192400," just fill the entire thing with the red so we can instantly see the boundaries of this entire thing"
1192400,1199680," chat answers yes same same for real for real i can really understand you uh right i also feel wrecked"
1199680,1206480," right now especially i don't have any tea i made some water right before the stream right i brewed some water"
1207520,1214720," uh okay so and because of that i feel kind of wrecked right now look at that isn't that poggers"
1214720,1224640," isn't a poggers i think it's pretty freaking poggers so this is the future canvas palette not canvas palette"
1224640,1229840," right so this is where we're going to be actually rendering all this thing uh right let me see i want"
1229840,1236960," i want to take a look at is there any padding yeah okay so it actually it actually said a little bit of a padding"
1236960,1246240," in here so if i made it for instance i'm really curious what if i made it not 150 all right but 160"
1246240,1253680," right so let me see what is going to happen is it gonna get or is it gonna not change at all"
1254960,1263040," uh i can't see i feel like it didn't change at all like completely something also broke somewhere here"
1263040,1268720," so what the hell is going on um can i just like um"
1268720,1276080," these dev tools is so cluttered i don't understand what the is going on oh it's just a favicon all right"
1276080,1284480," so uh let me let me see uh oh right so 160 i don't feel like it changed at all there's still"
1285520,1293360," yeah uh yeah i think it's just like uses this as a logical size and it just crammed it as much as"
1293360,1299440," it could so i don't think it's it matters that much but i'm gonna make it 150 anyway uh hopefully that"
1299440,1310240," will make it a little bit easier to to them you know parts of whatever okay that's pretty poggers i think"
1310240,1319040," that's pretty poggers uh the html server should return favicon automatically uh no because we don't"
1319040,1326720," have a favicon right so unfortunately and i couldn't bother to actually make one i'm sorry right um"
1326720,1336800," so let me let me see so what i need to do essentially i think i need to be able to handle clicks uh on this"
1336800,1342480," entire thing so let's actually add event listener uh all right and when you every time you click"
1342480,1348320," we're gonna say uh something like console lock uh palette"
1348320,1358320," has been clicked look at that that's how easy it is to do web development without any react you just"
1358320,1365840," get the dome elements you attach some listeners and you're good to go none of that react and it just"
1365840,1371440," works it just works okay let's give it a try so if i click in here and it doesn't work"
1373520,1377680," is that because i didn't recompile or or what what is going on the fuck"
1377680,1384000," ah it didn't work"
1384000,1393760," fuck uh oh now it works right i just forgot to recompile my dynamically uh dynamic language right i"
1393760,1399680," forgot to recompile my dynamic language palette has been clicked okay that's cool that's very poggers if i"
1399680,1409840," say so myself so essentially by the way um i want the um the palette to have a fixed amount of um columns"
1409840,1415760," right so essentially we're not going to adapt the amount of columns depending on the amount of states"
1415760,1421840," we have we're going to say okay we're going to have this amount of uh columns right and if we have more"
1421840,1427520," states we're going to wrap around to the next uh to the next row and so on and so forth the question is"
1427520,1436400," how many columns can we have right so we have 150 pixels right we have 150 pixels uh so let's actually"
1436400,1444480," factor out 150 so we have uh two three five five uh maybe having five um"
1446000,1452640," two maybe even six right so 150 is divisible by six right we can actually clearly see that"
1452640,1459680," uh right if i divide it by six it's 25 so we can use 25 pixels so we can say that we can have"
1459680,1466800," six columns in that specific palette in this specific palette we have seven right in my paint uh but here"
1466800,1472720," it is actually very easy to divide it by uh just six right does it make sense yeah i think i think"
1472720,1478800," it's pretty good uh i think it's pretty good uh i think it's pretty good um all right so let me let me see"
1478800,1488480," uh let's have some sort of uh constant console uh const not console const uh palette uh columns"
1488480,1495200," let's call it calls and we're gonna have six of them and uh that means that means we're gonna have"
1495200,1509040," uh palette um cell width which is essentially palette uh width divided by palette columns right so this is"
1509040,1515360," the width of a single cell in here uh so the thing i want to do in here so let's actually first clear"
1515360,1520240," the rectangle right so we're gonna clear it is that the thing in here yeah it is a thing in here which is"
1520240,1528720," kind of uh canvas rect huh so oh yeah the rectangle render context just implements one of these interfaces"
1528720,1536000," in here okay so that makes sense sure uh okay so then i need to take the current automaton right so i think"
1536000,1544240," the current automaton is the cute animation uh cute automaton right so and as far as i know it's essentially"
1545760,1555360," yeah so let's iterate uh through all of the colors in here so i'm gonna start with zero uh cute automaton"
1555360,1564560," uh it's an array of the states anyway right so it's an array of the states anyway so and i is basically"
1564560,1571920," an index right so i is basically an index and we need to be able to confirm it convert it to uh rows and"
1571920,1578720," columns of the current cell right we can probably quite easily say the row right so let's actually"
1578720,1589360," say that the row is i uh divided divided by the palette uh columns but we have to actually floor this"
1589360,1596720," entire thing because uh by default the numbers in javascript are uh flows right so it doesn't have a"
1597280,1602240," how is it called integer division and fair unfortunately right so and in terms of a call"
1602240,1610560," uh it's actually i uh palette uh mod right but in case of a mode uh is it going to work i wonder"
1610560,1621760," it's actually the state of uh integers and floats in in javascript is sad and confusing that's what that's"
1621760,1628560," what i can tell you it is sad and confusing so for now i'm going to just like print them uh just to see"
1628560,1633920," what the hell they're printing uh right i just want to see them uh first of all we probably want to go"
1633920,1640400," to somewhere here what is it called outer cell like it's called outer cell and i'm going to do node modules"
1640400,1646800," bin tsc uh watch there we go so we're gonna watch this entire thing"
1646800,1656640," uh all right so how can i learn about what current project is any command for that there is a today"
1656640,1661600," command oh okay so the chat actually already uh describes so yeah if you're in the chat you can"
1661600,1667360," always do the today command and you get the link to the current project uh maybe i could do a little bit"
1667360,1673440," better job describing what the project is in readme but it involves cellular automatons right so you need"
1673440,1682320," to be you need to know a little bit what a cellular automaton is at least uh right so that's essentially"
1682320,1685760," basically what we're doing we're doing a little bit of a computer science in here i'm sorry"
1685760,1693280," imagine clicking on the stream uh thinking that this is html programming and it technically"
1693280,1702960," it is true but we're also doing some computer science in here as well all right so uh okay"
1702960,1708880," guys so uh it will automatically recompile everything so let me refresh this entire thing and it seems to be"
1708880,1717520," um correct right so as soon as we have the seventh element it goes around on the row one and what's funny"
1717520,1723840," is that if i don't do floor in here will that work that's a very interesting question right so i probably"
1723840,1729760," don't have to recompile but i'm going to do that just in case uh right yeah it's just like"
1729760,1738240," god damn javascript like it's so derpy it's the derpiest language i've ever programmed with"
1738240,1745120," right so basically you have two symmetrical operations like division and mod right so but the division since"
1745120,1750400," javascript doesn't give a shit about whether it's a float or integer specifically for division you have"
1750400,1756800," to do the floor but since because sometimes you need mod and integer mod you don't have to do it in here"
1756800,1759440," it's so freaking derpy is it oh my god"
1759440,1764000," ah"
1764000,1767760," anyway i'm sorry"
1767760,1781200," all right so let's continue python is just better it is i do believe that python better"
1781920,1788480," because it has a stronger typing it is still dynamic typing it is still dynamic but it's stronger at"
1788480,1794240," least uh i think you can use a slash slash command instead of flower can i is that a thinking node"
1794240,1799680," uh i don't believe you all right if i just divide this by three it's gonna be that uh oh they have"
1799680,1806400," integer division like in python i didn't know that okay so all right they are slowly addressing the"
1806400,1808400," derpiness of the language right so it's like"
1808400,1815920," the fuck is this"
1828640,1835200," so how do they even tokenize that so wait a second so"
1835200,1847600," their tokenizer their tokenizer must understand the intent of the token to distinguish"
1848720,1852800," wait am i am i am i being dumb because"
1852800,1864240," oh i i just who trolled me okay so mods ban this person from then"
1864240,1877680," who's that freaking okay so i i i just remembered your uh yeah i just remembered your nickname i'm gonna add"
1877680,1881280," you to my to my to my waiting ban list so"
1881280,1890880," uh floor i'm joking i'm looking at that but it's actually kind of funny it's it's funny that i fall"
1890880,1898480," for that what the fuck like i was my my brain was rushing so much that i didn't even notice that"
1898480,1907360," it's not a thing and it's just like yeah wait so and i just did that and yeah my brain just saw that"
1907360,1912160," it just contracted into a single number but i didn't look properly what that number was"
1912160,1920080," yo that's a perfect trolling holy sh- okay i can respect that i can respect that"
1920080,1924000," anyway so in any case um"
1926560,1933200," in any case we uh we have to do florin here right and so um but this works right"
1933200,1942320," uh okay so now we have the coordinates of all of the cells so we can actually draw them right can't"
1942320,1948240," we so row is actually y and uh column is actually x so essentially what we can do"
1949040,1959040," uh we can do palettes uh palette ctx style and feel i think it's a style feel or feel style"
1959040,1969360," feel style and we can do cute automaton i and i think yeah we do have associated color of that specific"
1969360,1973760," state we we set it as a feel style and then it allows us to do ctx"
1973760,1980800," uh feel rect right and we're feeling x y but we have to multiply it by the palette"
1980800,1987920," uh palette cell width and i think i'm going to be uh making them square which means that this specific"
1987920,1995760," thing should be probably size uh it should be probably size not width so this is a size uh right and"
1995760,2002720," and then i'm gonna set this entire stuff i can't see shite in this mist i can't see scheisse"
2002720,2011520," in this mist okay so that's a little bit better so that will automatically uh populate uh like all"
2011520,2019680," this rows and hopefully so we're about to find out look at that yeah yeah here they all are right in here"
2020400,2027680," isn't that poggers i think it's pretty freaking so we can actually um um add more states in here"
2027680,2033760," we can try to add more states in here so essentially the actual image that we're processing in here right"
2033760,2039840," the actual image that we're processing in here is uh this one so just a second i'm gonna uh do something"
2039840,2046800," like this uh right it's this one so what i did i basically cut out only this image and i process only"
2046800,2052640," this thing uh but we have more right so which actually has more different colors in here"
2052640,2059680," right so to do that uh it should be relatively easy i just added a couple of parameters to the"
2059680,2064880," transcendental adhesion of image so that's the process of preparation the image for"
2064880,2068880," converting it to cell automaton right it's called transcendental apprehension of"
2068880,2074240," uh of the image so i added a couple of parameters that allow you to specify the rectangle"
2074800,2081520," for the transcendental apprehension and uh i only specify the size for for that specific character"
2081520,2086320," but then we can say okay use the entire image from the for the transcendental apprehension and it will"
2086320,2091200," work so yeah welcome to the html programming stream by the way"
2091200,2101440," so okay and uh let's refresh the center i think and as you can see we have more characters in here and"
2101440,2106560," furthermore in the palette we have more colors right because they are populated automatically so this"
2106560,2111760," entire thing uh whatever we have in here depends on like how we protest all of that and as far as i"
2111760,2117200," know like uh destroying all these characters will also work yeah there we go so you can you can destroy"
2117200,2124160," them individually if you want to uh right so what's interesting there's so many combinations of black uh"
2124160,2130880," uh cells that it's it's virtually indestructible right so there's too many of them they're very stable uh"
2130880,2137680," right but this one's actually it's basically what we have in here so and i want to be able to actually"
2137680,2144000," click on those things and select the current color sort of speak if you know what i mean right select the"
2144000,2149360," current color so the way we actually do that in other applications there's just we have some sort of a"
2150160,2156560," border around this entire thing right and maybe this is how we're gonna indicate the currently selected"
2156560,2165280," color for the palette as well uh right so the yeah the ninja is actually very resistant but his face is not"
2165280,2172080," particularly resistant right don't clip that out of the context context please right yes"
2173760,2179520," it's actually quite funny and it's kind of funny that it leaves the outlines of these things"
2179520,2190960," right it just leaves the outlines uh anyways uh right so we need to have we need to have a variable"
2190960,2200080," that keeps track of the currently selected color uh i think we also have got some subs uh so actually one sub"
2200880,2206720," thank you so much bad atom automata that's exactly what we're doing right thank you so much bad automata"
2206720,2214720," for uh zero one subscription thank you thank you thank you right so actually pretty cool so let's say"
2214720,2221280," that the currently selected color right so current actually state right as already said is it's a state"
2221280,2227280," uh it's going to be like this variable it's going to be a very simple variable current state right so it's"
2227280,2232000," going to be 0 and how we're going to be uh like basically rendering all of that how we're going to be"
2232000,2242160," rendering all that uh well here we render the cell and if the i right i is the current state we have to draw"
2242160,2249680," additional stuff we have to draw additional stuff that indicates that that specific color is the selected one"
2249680,2260720," right uh right uh and how we can do that i suppose we can just draw some you know border probably uh we'll"
2260720,2269680," see we'll see so let me take a look at the palette uh palette ctx uh we have few rectangle but do we have"
2269680,2275520," something like uh stroke rectangle yeah that's that's probably what we want uh so we have a structure"
2275520,2283840," rectangle and um essentially what if i use the same uh the same thing in here all right what if i use the"
2283840,2294080," same thing in here uh it's too big honestly it's kind of like too big uh can i uh can i simplify it like"
2294080,2303600," it would be better if this entire constant was smaller uh that size uh maybe so that's already a bit better"
2303600,2313120," so i can put that in here uh all right so this is a palette size actually not sell that size there we go"
2313120,2321280," so this is a palette size that's already manageable which is nice and we may probably have uh a very"
2321280,2329840," specific um stroke style for this kind of thing uh palette ctx uh stroke style yeah there we go but what"
2329840,2336560," what kind of stroke styles can we have uh canvas gradient all right so canvas gradient is add color"
2336560,2343440," stop uh okay so this is probably not we want uh canvas pattern set transform um"
2343440,2353280," okay so let me google up uh this kind of stuff so html5 canvas uh stroke style um"
2354720,2358720," width color and let's actually use google this time"
2358720,2369440," uh so stroke style property w3 schools uh yes w3 schools uh so i suppose okay so we can provide"
2369440,2375600," the color that is fine uh let's set the color to maybe white all right so because it can be very much"
2375600,2386000," visible uh on the dark background right so uh but furthermore what if i want it to be thick what if i"
2386000,2394640," want it to be back so there is a uh line width all right oh and this is how you set the gradient right"
2394640,2400560," so i remember that uh the stroke style was also accepting gradient and stuff like that uh but ultimately"
2400560,2404960," what we need in here is probably line width all right so let's go ahead and do that so palette"
2404960,2411600," ctx line uh width all right and let's say it's going to be five and let's see how it's going to work"
2411600,2415760," all right so we're going to recompile this into i think probably not required because we already have"
2415760,2422560," outer recompilation uh right and let's refresh this and i think and as you can see look at that"
2422560,2432240," it is uh actually it looks good actually i'm surprised so uh okay what if now i say that the"
2432240,2439360," current state that the current state is one right the current state is one so this entire thing this"
2439360,2447920," entire rectangle is going to move to the next line yeah uh and it looks weird it looks a bit weird"
2447920,2455920," i'm not really sure why but maybe this is because like how all of this works uh right so the right"
2455920,2465840," side somehow thicker than the rest of the sides how does that make any sense like"
2469440,2479440," um okay so maybe i don't even know how the thickness is computed in this specific case"
2479440,2486400," maybe one of the things i need to do uh right i need to have the thickness uh as a value here let's"
2486400,2494000," actually do the thickness and uh maybe what i'm going to do i'm gonna shrink this rectangle according"
2494000,2497920," to the thickness uh let's actually make it smaller right so because i'm going to be using that in the"
2497920,2505600," mathematical expressions uh right so here is going to be uh thick uh plus thick and to shrink it we have"
2505600,2513440," to subtract uh thick from the size but we have to subtract two of them uh right so maybe that's how"
2513440,2520880," it's going to work but it just depends on how exactly this thing is implemented uh right so uh yeah"
2521680,2529440," this one is interesting uh i see so it actually goes inside because of that it probably yeah yeah i see"
2529440,2538640," what's going on it probably uh can see uh considers the actual counter of the line the middle of the"
2538640,2545200," drone line so the actual line goes in here and the thickness is basically spreading uh outwards from the"
2545200,2551600," contour so this is probably how it's implemented this is how i implemented the frame function in olivette"
2552240,2556800," right uh so for this who doesn't know olivette is just like a graphics library that worked on"
2556800,2563440," some time ago uh right so so doing github olivette you can find this entire thing in here right if you're"
2563440,2569600," interested there is links in there i'm gonna give the link in the description as well right"
2571360,2581440," oh that's pretty sure to be and uh if we take a look at how it's done right so um"
2581440,2595600," so there are some tests for the frame yeah here it is uh yeah so there are some test cases which"
2595600,2601600," demonstrate the thickness so they actually draw on the frame is the white one and the red one is the"
2601600,2608800," the the actual contour that uh like relatively to which it is computed so here is a good example because"
2608800,2616640," it demonstrates the odd thickness the thickness with all the amount of pixels uh right so i even tested"
2616640,2621760," things like that like this entire thing is like pixel perfect there's a lot of edge cases to make this"
2621760,2628560," kind of stuff pixel perfect uh which is kind of fun i think right so and it's actually super fun to"
2628560,2634480," develop this kind of thing all right so because of that i think uh we just need to subtract just a"
2634480,2640880," single thickness uh all right so we're subtracting just a single single thickness and it looks like"
2640880,2654080," shit why does it look like maybe because we have to then subtract half of the thickness maybe that's the"
2654080,2663840," reason maybe that's what you want uh let's refresh perfect look at that look at that perfection look at that"
2665200,2670960," it's just perfection in my opinion we can make it maybe slightly less thick let's actually use three"
2670960,2680880," pixels let's use three pixels i'm gonna refresh this and test it and that's even better yes so what i'm"
2680880,2686960," trying to achieve is just basically this thing to be with the like contained within the cell itself"
2686960,2689600," right so that's what i'm trying to do um"
2689600,2699520," so five web dev streams in a row maybe toting got a starbucks opened up nearby"
2699520,2702640," no all the starbucks actually left my country"
2702640,2708160," which caused the entire it infrastructure collapse"
2709120,2710640," so uh all right"
2710640,2718320," let's continue so i think like three is actually pretty uh pretty good thickness"
2718320,2722000," pretty good thickness"
2722000,2732240," so now the next thing we need to do we need to handle the clickage right we need to uh implement the clickage"
2733600,2741120," how we're going to be doing all of that so what i'm thinking right so the current uh state is basically"
2741120,2746960," this uh we need some function right that redraws the state of the palette right so let's actually do"
2746960,2755600," something like const uh redraw uh maybe re what's called redraw palette palette uh right so this is going"
2755600,2762000," going to be something like that and we're going to take all the code that is responsible for all of this"
2762000,2767600," stuff uh and move it inside of the function except the constants because the constants are going to be"
2767600,2773520," useful for the click as well right because we need to compute the coordinates somehow uh right so this is"
2773520,2783520," the redraw the palette and here we redraw the palette so when we're clicking on the palette when"
2783520,2790160," we're clicking on the palette we're going to be modifying the current uh state right so we're going"
2790160,2796560," to be modifying the current state um but we need to determine on on which cell we're clicking right"
2796560,2800160," so that's what we need to do so for now i'm going to do the following thing uh i'm going to"
2800160,2807520," basically increment it by one with a mode of cute uh automaton length right so it will scroll through"
2807520,2812080," right so because i want to see how it reacts uh to this kind of thing without actually implementing"
2812080,2819440," the handling right so i just want you you know you just want to test that uh right so we're implementing"
2819440,2825280," this kind of ui incrementally okay so if i click on this thing as you can see it scrolls through uh these"
2825280,2830640," things it just scrolls through them it doesn't know on which i'm clicking but it just goes through them"
2830640,2840640," uh which is kind of interesting we can already technically uh do the following thing every time i click"
2841520,2849040," uh on the board itself what we're setting in here we're just setting whatever is picked by the radio"
2849040,2854880," button but we don't really have to right because like understanding what is picked by our radio button"
2854880,2860560," requires for loop we don't really need that stuff anymore what we can say every time you clicked on"
2860560,2868160," this thing just set it to the current state uh this is actually perfect that makes it so much simpler"
2868160,2877280," holy so it already works so we don't need to do that that yeah holy fuck using this kind of canvas based"
2877280,2889360," widget actually simplifies the code what the fuck yo that's so good um right so because you don't need to"
2889360,2894160," deal yeah and the reason why it simplifies the code is because you don't need to deal with the"
2895200,2900800," uh web dome bullshit anymore it's just like you don't have to deal like you've got just a canvas"
2900800,2905520," with pixels and just do whatever the fuck you want with it you don't have to deal with the tone just"
2905520,2912880," render whatever you want and it just makes it simpler um right so that's pretty cool so what that means"
2912880,2922800," chat what that means uh that means that i can already draw uh whatever color i want i can already pick and draw with"
2922800,2928880," whatever colors i want i can already do that it's a thing and then i can continue playing"
2928880,2936160," the cell automaton but it dies obviously all right but uh yeah so it already works the only thing that"
2936160,2942160," is missing is to actually pick the actual color uh that you clicked on so right now it just scrolls"
2942160,2949360," through them uh which is not particularly great right uh but uh right we'll have to like determine on"
2949360,2963040," which cell we click there all right so uh let's continue let's continue so let me see uh we're redrawing"
2963040,2971840," the palette and what we need to do in here right so we clicked on the palette and we need to determine the"
2971840,2980560," coordinates right so i think we have to take the offset offset x and offset y uh right offset x and offset y"
2981280,2988800," so but here we're going to be defining by uh by actually the palette size rather than uh"
2988800,2996640," rather than the other things so uh rather than cell width and cell height uh palette"
2996640,3004560," size right so this is going to palette size and this one is going to be the uh also palette size because"
3004560,3011200," they are square right they're actually square uh we've got some sub thank you so much uh travius"
3011200,3016240," uh for twitchpan subscription thank you thank you thank you your first subscription welcome to our epic"
3016240,3024480," html club how about that uh right so this gives us x and y but this gives us only row and column"
3024480,3030640," of this entire thing right but the state is actually continuous the state is actually continuous so that means"
3031440,3040080," the actual state is uh we take the column which is y and multiply by the palette uh palette columns"
3040080,3048960," right so uh and then add the x so that gives us the actual state that we selected but what that means"
3048960,3053440," that means you can actually select some of the states that are outside of the available range so if you"
3053440,3060080," click here it will select the state that is bigger uh than you know the size of the cute automaton right"
3060080,3064640," it's bigger than the size of the cute automaton uh right so essentially we need to check for that"
3064640,3076560," right so if state is less than uh cute automaton length what we're doing we're setting that state to the"
3076560,3084000," current state right so we're just doing that um otherwise i suppose we're just ignoring it and if we're"
3084000,3088480," ignoring i suppose there's no need to re-render anything we're gonna just like re-render only when we"
3088480,3093840," actually modify the current current current state uh and there we go so that seems to be working that"
3093840,3104000," seems to be at working right hopefully we'll see okay so if i click here look at that so i can probably"
3104000,3110960," like zoom in a little bit so we can see scheisse uh so i can now select between these things and this is"
3110960,3119200," purely canvas this is purely can isn't that cool isn't that freaking cool right so this is not a like"
3119200,3125920," html component or anything like that it's just like a like a canvas if you know what i mean uh just a"
3125920,3134640," second uh right so this is actually kind of cool and it makes it simpler surprisingly like coding this kind"
3134640,3140800," of thing is much simpler than messing with html css and some other shit right so it's just like yeah"
3140800,3146240," super easy the only thing that i lack in here is some sort of like a visual feedback that you can click"
3146240,3152240," on those things i would like to have a similar rectangle when i hover over those things like in"
3152240,3157120," case of a well in case of here we don't really see that but but i want to be able to see that i can"
3157120,3162400," click on this thing uh right so maybe this is something that we can do uh right so if we do"
3162400,3172640," palette add event listener and we're going to say a mouse uh mouse move and this is going to be this"
3172640,3179520," thing right so this is a mouse move and on each mouse move we of course determine um the state right"
3181040,3186960," and if the state um is one of these things"
3186960,3197600," this one is a little bit uh this one is a little bit s so what i'm thinking is that we need to keep"
3197600,3205520," track of the state that is hovered uh if you know what i mean all right so and we're gonna use that state"
3206720,3217120," hovered um state uh so for now i think i'm gonna say it's no right but the type of the center i think"
3217120,3228560," can be either number or no right so we can do something like this and if uh i is current we're gonna do that"
3228560,3239920," then if uh harvard state is i maybe i'm gonna actually you know swap them so it's symmetrical to this thing"
3239920,3251040," uh i can probably copy paste this entire thing in here but instead of cola white we're gonna use color"
3251040,3257520," gray is that how it's called gray i think uh we can probably move the thickness up there and remove it from here"
3258560,3269520," uh so let me let me see uh any point in moving all calculations to wasm i was actually thinking about that"
3269520,3276480," all right so if we can come up with any interesting cell automatons right generated based on images"
3277280,3289280," we may try um we may try um working um we may try working on uh processing bigger images right and then um"
3289280,3296800," we'll probably need more computing power and that may require moving some of the logic to wasm"
3298240,3309120," uh right we'll see so for instance we can move the actual next board uh computation right compute next"
3309120,3317520," board we can move the uh storage of the state of the board to web assembly memory and the um uh the"
3317520,3323920," process of computing the next board to like web assembly as well and the javascript side is only going"
3323920,3329440," to pull out the state the render state of the board and just display through a canvas but all the"
3329440,3334480," computations all the number crunching is going to be done on wasm if we really need to have that"
3334480,3341200," right so we just look move all of the heavy stuff to wasm but i'm not sure if we'll find anything"
3341200,3345680," particularly interesting in this specific product but we'll see maybe we'll be able to find something"
3346800,3355040," okay uh so uh what do we do in here uh right so essentially we have a hovered state and what i need"
3355040,3362640," to do um when we're moving we just found that we're hovering over some existing things and i think is"
3362640,3372000," less than uh one of these stuff so we can just say uh hovered hovered state is equal to the state but"
3372000,3380880," otherwise uh it is equal to null right so that will mean that it's not gonna render anything no true"
3380880,3389680," uh all right and we redraw everything every time i think we have to redraw this thing here yeah"
3389680,3392000," i think we have to redraw it so i'm gonna put it in here"
3394720,3407360," okay okay um so we've got some sub uh uh at actoni barrietta thank you so much for it with"
3407360,3414720," current thank you thank you uh all right so what the hell is going on in here declaration or statement"
3414720,3423760," expected what did i forget to put some stuff what what"
3423760,3434800," these kind of problems are the worst because you don't okay so there's a problem with um curly brace i"
3434800,3443440," forgot to put a curly brace somewhere or close but i can't see where did i forget to close or did something"
3444080,3448800," what the"
3448800,3456240," no semicolon no it's not because of semicolon but there's something"
3456240,3464320," there's something more weird in here i forgot to either open or close somewhere and the compiler is not"
3464320,3473280," gonna tell me uh line 22 line 22 where what where did you get line 22"
3473440,3486160," so we've got some more subs um um"
3486160,3490320," um nino's hour thank you so much for twitch prime thank you thank you thank you"
3493040,3504080," okay okay uh this is so dumb"
3504080,3514960," oh my god like it could have like at least give more information or something like that just to help me"
3514960,3522400," locate this exact like place this is bad this kind of error reporting is so bad oh my god"
3523040,3529360," oh jesus like you forgot to put curly brace in here"
3529360,3538160," good luck good luck good luck typescript is not gonna tell you where it's good oh i don't know it's closing"
3538160,3556880," i don't know oh jesus jesus jesus my god okay all right i'm sorry let's refresh this"
3556880,3567280," look at that so this makes sense uh is it even visible is it even visible right but it it gives"
3567280,3574320," sort of like a feedback uh right on what you can click on what you can click on right"
3576480,3583200," look cool i think it's pretty cool so yeah so that means by the way um"
3583200,3594720," we can finally get rid of this sort of like a brush if you know what i mean right so this sort of brush"
3594720,3601200," we can finally get rid of that and we're only gonna have like this specific palette and the buttons right"
3601200,3607280," so that's actually perfect uh so let me remove your mom i mean that's the name of the field set right so"
3607280,3614720," it's called your mom so we can remove that uh and uh we probably need to remove everything related to"
3614720,3622240," that stuff your mom i don't think we were even using it in the javascript code that much i don't think we"
3622240,3629520," were even referring to this kind of thing yeah it will just work now all right i can pause i can add"
3630160,3637200," some stuff in here so we can actually draw with all of these colors if we want to right so and let's"
3637200,3646960," just play and actually destroy this entire thing uh yeah that's pretty cool"
3646960,3659840," okay so uh that's pretty poggers so what we effectively did uh so we have out of"
3659840,3664400," populate radio buttons based on the current out automaton and this is basically what we did"
3664400,3671520," right so this is basically we did we created this sort of palette that you can just uh use so let's"
3671520,3679280," go ahead and uh go back to the original smaller image of one person right we did that so how many columns"
3679280,3685200," we have we have four columns uh right so this is the four columns and in terms of rows we have three rows"
3685920,3688240," uh right so we have three rows"
3688240,3697760," and let's go so here's that and as you can see the palette actually became like smaller so it doesn't"
3697760,3704560," contains the other colors that you that you don't have so if i put yeah it instantly disappears"
3705360,3714160," so it it instantly disappears because of the way we sort of like um prepare a cell automaton right we go"
3714160,3720960," through each individual cell we look at its neighbors right we look at its neighbors and basically for that"
3720960,3735760," if there's any other combination of characters of states and um other combinations of states"
3735760,3743840," and neighbors it actually falls apart so that's why it doesn't really stay for too long it only stays in"
3743840,3751600," this exact specific combination of uh of states so we can try to do something more stable uh even more"
3751600,3760240," stable than it is right so for instance if in that specific state we have these specific neighbors"
3760240,3768320," we're basically keep staying in that specific state right so if in this state we have that we keep staying in"
3768320,3777360," in that specific state uh so the initial expected so basically the default uh state is zero basically the"
3777360,3786560," background the left top corner what if we check the following thing if you are in a state zero and you have"
3786560,3793520," the same neighbors as the neighbors in some other states that we found that we observed uh right and we never"
3793520,3803840," actually encountered that thing before we're basically going to switch the empty uh state to that state that"
3803840,3809680," we're currently observing right will that create something more stable right let's actually find out"
3809680,3820080," triple equals yeah huh it's actually less stable"
3822400,3832000," but it's just like collapsed very quickly huh that's funny uh what if i pause and i add a bunch of"
3832000,3839920," different things right so it's so cool that i can just like do that and it all disappeared so it doesn't"
3839920,3851280," uh maybe we have to do some some other shenanigans here yeah the only stable thing is is the uh the black"
3851280,3855360," uh outline uh outline so we can try to maybe actually"
3855360,3861040," yeah we can actually try to go through all that's actually very cool idea"
3861040,3867760," so essentially if we observe this specific state we're going to do that for each individual state"
3867760,3871680," uh so"
3871680,3881120," so how can we iterate through all of these states in here so it's gonna it's gonna be i less than cute automaton"
3881280,3893280," uh length uh plus plus i right and in here if we encounter that for that state we just switch to"
3893280,3899200," that that will include zero as well and the state itself even for the situation when i is equal to the"
3899200,3904560," state so it just basically includes all of that stuff huh that's not a bad idea that's an interesting"
3904560,3907760," idea uh i wonder what it will turn into"
3907760,3921920," so one cool idea would be to extract this state evaluation method to a text file so we can modify it"
3921920,3929120," on the fly by the eval maybe i'm not sure uh oh that's very interesting"
3933440,3942560," so if i have some other things in here right now they still fall apart i want to come up with"
3942560,3951760," something that it doesn't fall apart every time right how can we create some yo that's so cool"
3954720,3961360," okay what if we wait that creates such a cool effect holy shit um okay"
3961360,3972080," so what if we start not uh playing all right so here we set the interval so what if"
3972080,3982800," we initially start at null what the okay let's also make it slower all right uh i'm gonna recompile"
3983920,3989760," that's okay that's so cool uh i could probably achieve that without several automatons but that's kind"
3989760,3995920," of cool that it can still do that so by default it doesn't really play uh so here's the next state"
3995920,4002960," and the whole thing is just like they're sort of melting and this residual thing like continues to"
4005280,4008240," yo what the"
4008240,4008560," um"
4008560,4021920," that's so funny similar destruction yeah so destruction that's that's so funny uh but"
4021920,4027920," when it plays a little bit faster like 100 right so if the period is 100 right so just like"
4028560,4043360," so cool uh so uh we're already streaming for one hour let me actually do a committee committee right"
4043360,4050320," let me do a committee committee and uh we're gonna make a small break and after the break i'm going to"
4050320,4059840," try to uh maybe play with more different ideas on uh how to automatically generate cell automatons based"
4059840,4065280," on the images or maybe we can try uh like other images right maybe bigger images and see how it goes"
4066080,4075120," uh right make two cell or organism fight each other i wish i knew how to do that though so uh that's the"
4075120,4076080," problem um"
4077760,4083600," uh all right so what right now what i'm trying to do i'm just trying to procedurally generate the"
4083600,4089280," rules of cell automatons based on the images but the question is what kind of"
4089280,4097440," interesting rules we can generate based on the images like what can we find there uh right so"
4097440,4104000," right now we're just basically looking at the current neighbors expected neighbors and just like"
4104000,4111440," trying to do something with that right if if anyone got any ideas on what kind of how can we procedurally"
4111440,4118640," generate some cell automatons feel free to actually suggest uh allow more neighbors uh combinations to be"
4118640,4128160," stable yeah sounds sounds like an interesting thing to to do um but how though um"
4130080,4138320," that is an interesting idea okay so let me do a committee committee um okay implement state uh palette"
4138320,4146480," instead of uh hard coded radio buttons instead of credit radio buttons i'm going to push that"
4146480,4151600," right into the repo right so it's going to be available in the repo you can find the source code"
4151600,4158000," of this entire thing here if you are interested so there's uh also um automatically deployed on github"
4158000,4163200," pages right it doesn't have a back end that's why it just like works uh though the github pages haven't"
4163200,4168480," updated yet so it's an old version so it doesn't contain the palette or anything like that uh yes we"
4168480,4172560," used to get some okay let's make a small break i'm gonna make a cup of tea and then after the break"
4172560,4182960," we're gonna continue um all right so let's continue let's try to like maybe um have more images let's try it on"
4182960,4190400," different images so the image that we're testing all of that stuff on is rather small uh right so and"
4190400,4198800," that's why it works fast so the image itself is 64 by 48 pixels right so we just scale it up so much"
4198800,4203680," uh right but it's a very small image by itself right so if you take a look at the actual image of these"
4203680,4210480," characters here they are can you see them uh right so if i open the the web application so here are the"
4210480,4218880," characters but this is their real size okay can you see them it's like you can see uh so but if you"
4218880,4226880," zoom in so here they are it's very small so let's actually try to maybe use something a little bit bigger"
4226880,4235520," maybe not that bigger for example uh kappa let's use kappa can i use kappa uh copy image address"
4235520,4248400," copy image address so and i'm going to do w get and o kappa png there we go we've got some a kappa it's"
4248400,4254240," still small image but i suppose it is uh bigger no it's actually smaller surprisingly"
4254240,4264960," oh let's use it anyway uh so i'm gonna go to index uh so here is the cute people might as well just do"
4264960,4274240," something like image uh image path right uh image path equal to this and i'm gonna command it out and here"
4274240,4282640," i'm gonna replace this and i think with kappa how about that isn't that a pogors a pogors"
4282640,4285600," i think it is absolutely pogors"
4285600,4293200," carbon has a very similar colors yes but if they are different uh they're going to be considered"
4293200,4299360," different states so that's what's interesting about that yeah so here's how many states we have in here"
4301120,4308720," so which also probably means that some of them are not fully visible uh which raises the question okay"
4308720,4311520," so let me maybe adapt some stuff um"
4311520,4322240," so uh let me let me see it's actually kind of cool so this is a huge copper"
4322240,4327840," at the same time you can even draw in here right so we can remove some of these things"
4328560,4334640," like so right but this is this is a real copper so the next state of this copper uh nothing really"
4334640,4340000," changing right so let's actually keep playing and let's remove and copper is disappearing"
4340000,4344560," that's a funny one right"
4344560,4356800," rest in peace copper uh so what i need to do i need to double check that we can even fit all that stuff in"
4356800,4366240," there right so we set the width to 150 right but after that we need to know uh what we can do so"
4366240,4373840," acute automaton right automaton we take the length and we need to divide this entire thing by the palette"
4373840,4380400," uh columns and that gives us the amount of rows we have to also do math floor of course because we don't"
4380400,4386080," have a uh you know integer division and this is not an integer division we already know that"
4386080,4394000," right so this gives us the amount of rows if we multiply this entire stuff by this size"
4394000,4403040," we'll get the height of the palette which we widget uh that we have to set to accommodate all of them"
4403840,4411760," that's how we do that that's math isn't it well it's more about arithmetics or maybe even geometry"
4411760,4416400," but i mean nothing special uh it's a very small subset of math"
4416400,4424000," all right so i wonder if that will actually increase the entire yeah there we go so this"
4424000,4437120," is how many states we have in here so it has a lot of similar gray states so that's that's why i wanted"
4437120,4439600," to do that because i knew that it probably cannot accommodate all of them"
4442240,4452000," which also means by the way that um if uh we have too many colors all of the controls for the for this"
4452000,4462480," thing are actually down below which is not uh particularly um particularly convenient um seal yeah"
4462480,4468400," maybe i need to do seal by the way that's actually a good point yeah i think something like seals is uh"
4468400,4474160," like will fit because we're gonna have a remainder and we have to extend it to accommodate that remainder"
4474160,4480080," okay thank you thank you so maybe we're actually missing uh one of the one of the things in here"
4480080,4486240," do we let me double check because it's too even yeah yeah so we're we're missing some remainder"
4486240,4491680," and as you can see there's like an empty thing in here thank you thank you so much all right so this"
4491680,4495280," is not particularly convenient because the all the controls are down there so one of the things we"
4495280,4504960," probably want to do is to um go here and uh take all of the lebatons uh take all of the lebatons and move"
4504960,4514640," them in here might as well even put them in separate diff just in case all right so here are lebatons and"
4514640,4520480," there we go so this is the next uh we compute the next thing in here and it just like disappears"
4521120,4528720," uh completely uh completely there we go that's pretty poggers isn't it i think that's pretty cool uh so"
4528720,4534720," let's take a look at some other images right let's take a look at some other maybe even bigger"
4534720,4544400," images something like sodium pogger so let's actually do sodium pogger uh can i can you download copy image"
4544400,4556160," address uh image image um so this is version two can i have version yeah let's let's try to download that uh"
4556160,4571680," sodium pogger png uh not hat that we get uh okay so we'll get that but it's rather small um 56 by 56 i"
4571680,4577040," i should define on load where is unloading"
4577040,4589600," this is not what i wanted uh what i wanted is just like rebuild the center i think"
4591600,4604320," uh-huh yo what the fuck why why i mean didn't i all right i thought actually"
4604320,4611440," this is not supposed to be like that it's supposed to adapt um"
4612800,4620000," yeah it's supposed to adapt the height to this entire thing and it's just like it shouldn't be like"
4620000,4626320," that for sure for sure for sure sodium toll yeah exactly sodium toll"
4626320,4634800," that is weird so maybe something cashed in there or maybe something else because"
4636160,4643280," i explicitly wrote the code that shit like that should not happen ever but it still happens"
4643280,4651840," uh so canvas is constrained horizontally yeah i know so um"
4651840,4660800," because of that i actually do app height where i take the current board"
4661600,4668320," height uh divided by the current board width and multiplied by that which is"
4668320,4675200," extremely weird all right so let me take a look at the console logs in here so we do a lot of console"
4675200,4680960," logs in here that are not particularly needed right so they're kind of distracting in my opinion"
4680960,4683360," right let's refresh that"
4683360,4688000," so that's cool"
4691600,4696400," so let me"
4696400,4704400," maybe take a look at this value i just want to see"
4704400,4709200," it's one"
4709200,4719280," how is that all right so they only can be one when they're equal to each other"
4721200,4726000," all right"
4726000,4739920," 56 by 56. uh that is true so that means it's one and that means we're setting app width to itself"
4739920,4744000," uh all right so if i take app um maybe"
4744000,4751040," width is that something i can do yeah app height yeah it is correct"
4751200,4780000," is the palette forcing the height uh it might be okay we're using flexbox is there any way to tell the flexbox brah don't force this thing"
4780000,4787920," uh flex items stretch by default okay so how can we not stretch it i see i see so that explains it"
4787920,4792000," well we learned something we actually learned something so i'm using"
4792000,4797760," god damn it so flex is supposed to like solve problems why is it creating more problems"
4799760,4806640," maybe maybe i don't know how to use it"
4806640,4807760," maybe i just don't know how to use it right uh all right okay um"
4807760,4812960," so how can i just tell it not to stretch"
4812960,4821440," uh let's ask chat iccp flex grow zero doesn't tell me anything you're guys just throwing stuff out of the context"
4822320,4833120," okay uh okay uh all right so it's actually oh probably um yeah okay uh i have two elements in um"
4834960,4848640," flex flex flex flex um so let's actually in a container container container with display flex"
4849600,4865280," two uh html elements uh how can i make the one not to stretch the other uh vertically okay"
4867200,4877440," uh prompting engineer stream yes and the prompt engineer generate the code already nobody gives a"
4877440,4884880," shit code okay so maybe somebody gives a shit okay so to prevent one html from stretching another"
4884880,4891040," vertically in container with flex you can use align self property on the element that you want to modify"
4891040,4897760," for example suppose you have two elements element one uh inside uh all right if you want to prevent"
4897760,4903360," element two from stretching element one vertically you could add the following css to element two"
4903360,4905920," align self flex starts"
4905920,4912800," so to prevent two from stretching element one"
4912800,4916320," that's really weird i don't"
4917840,4925280," css is weird not gonna lie but um yeah so you're telling me that that will solve the problem right"
4925280,4930880," so you're literally telling me that that somehow solves the problem it doesn't"
4930880,4940480," uh it's a chinese instance of uh chat gpt yeah so this doesn't solve the problem so"
4942240,4948160," um so i don't really see did it lie to me i think it lies so let's actually try to generate a different"
4948160,4957200," response um align self okay finally it at least gives html all right"
4957200,4962240," css cool"
4966400,4968000," didn't i literally did that"
4968000,4973600," um align items"
4973600,4988080," i think i literally did that and it didn't work i think i'm like pretty confident though uh i can try"
4988080,4993360," to do that without inline style like i used inline style so maybe that's why i didn't like it"
4994400,5000880," or something um wait a freaking second i have to do that on controls okay so i see"
5000880,5008000," so this is not an element of the flex control this is the element so that's quite important okay"
5008000,5012800," okay so that that makes sense so let's actually put it in here um style"
5016400,5021840," align itself go align yourself go align yourself oh go align yourself"
5021840,5032400," all right so is it going to work no it didn't it didn't work but again i didn't have a dev tools"
5032400,5038960," uh so you have dev tools"
5042800,5050000," right so but why does it say all right to prevent from stretching child one"
5050000,5055120," so did it just lie to me and i have to actually apply this thing here"
5055120,5063040," did it just fucking lie to me what a freaking really"
5067760,5073120," this motherfucker lied to me so to prevent child two from stretching"
5073120,5081120," this is child two and it was stretching it you"
5081120,5083680," okay"
5087120,5109520," no no you have to apply align self to child one minus what handed social uh social create"
5109520,5120960," the future of programming everyone it still helped though right i should have actually"
5120960,5123520," googled it up i think if i googled it up it would be faster"
5125760,5130160," all the future of programming the programmers not need it anymore"
5130160,5137920," we're all gonna be replaced by mark of chains"
5137920,5141840," sorry okay"
5141840,5145760," ai is gonna end the world"
5148640,5155680," yes yes yes yes we use kawaii freaking this uh so well yeah okay so i completely forgot what the"
5155680,5161680," fuck i was doing yes right so we'll get this uh it's a sodium paug isn't it i think it's pretty"
5161680,5175520," uh let me let me let me try to play this entire thing"
5183200,5194240," yo"
5194240,5201360," it's especially funny that it's doing that from eyes it's just like so cursed"
5201360,5212480," uh so i think it doesn't do that with uh kappa i'm pretty sure it doesn't do that with kappa"
5213200,5214560," we just try to do the kappa"
5214560,5226720," um it is burning yeah yeah it doesn't doesn't do that yeah the kappa is boring the kappa is boring"
5226720,5230480," the sodium pogue sodium pogue is kind of pogue"
5235680,5239600," so we're going to balance nothing and there we go there we go"
5239600,5243520," okay okay"
5243520,5247360," so i've got an idea actually"
5247360,5255280," i've got an idea so essentially um"
5255280,5260640," can i can i draw this into i think i want to kind of draw it"
5265280,5268080," uh imagine that we have a bunch of cells"
5268080,5270080," right"
5270080,5279120," so these are the cells these are the cells"
5279120,5288560," right so and we're basically iterating through all of the pixels of the image and we're analyzing the"
5288560,5294400," more neighborhood right so basically all of the neighboring things and we notice that"
5294880,5301680," uh we have a pixel with a certain combination of neighbors let's say it's going to be like zero"
5301680,5309680," to one and this pixel uh also have this combination of numbers zero to one but they"
5309680,5312880," have different colors right they have different colors"
5312880,5322000," so and what if we make an analysis uh so basically some sort of like a table where we basically collect"
5323280,5331360," uh all of the colors that have that specific uh that specific neighborhood right c1"
5331360,5338480," uh c2 blah blah blah then we have another neighborhood like two one uh one or whatever"
5338480,5342400," this is not not like a real neighborhood or something like that but we have a table"
5342400,5350960," right right neighborhood and all of its colors and then what if we say okay if you are being in a state"
5350960,5361280," of c1 with this neighborhood you switch to state c2 then if you are in state of c2 with this neighborhood you"
5361280,5367200," switch to c3 and basically for each of the neighborhood we get all of the cars that we have in here and we"
5367200,5372240," create rules that cycle through them does make sense"
5372240,5380160," that's an interesting idea so what will happen and we will take the image we analyze all the pixels with"
5380160,5386800," all the neighborhoods and we find uh the one that have the same neighborhood and the the pixels with the"
5386800,5394160," same neighborhood they let's let them cycle through themselves right uh what it will create what kind of"
5394160,5399440," effects it will create that's a very interesting question i don't freaking know i don't freaking know"
5399440,5407840," let's find out uh cycling rules but that actually modifies right so this will modify the color which"
5407840,5413200," will modify the neighborhood for that thing so it will become different so there might be some"
5413200,5416720," emerging behaviors that we don't expect it's kind of difficult to predict what's going to happen"
5417440,5421200," uh if something like that happens or if we if we caught something like that"
5421200,5430320," right so but let's actually see so we also have like like more um you know images to test this kind"
5430320,5436880," of stuff on uh right we have more images but we're gonna start with the original one with the original cute"
5436880,5447760," people um original people so these ones uh which are basically just melting down right now they're actually"
5447760,5456560," kind of cool how they melt down uh all right so let me see so but i don't want to remove the current"
5456560,5465280," way of doing things right so essentially i maybe want to extract this to a separate function right so we have"
5465280,5468960," a transcendental apprehension of the image which just prepares the image"
5468960,5473680," and here we probably want to have a function that accepts both of them"
5473680,5484560," generate the rules right and this thing is going to accept the board right so the board itself and"
5484560,5491840," automaton for which we are generating the rules so automaton uh so it's not going to return anything but"
5492960,5497760," we are going to put this entire thing in here so generate the rules"
5497760,5512480," cute board uh cute uh automaton uh automaton there we go and we may want to career replace cute board"
5512480,5526800," uh with automaton uh with automaton there we go so let's actually see if this entire thing compiles"
5526800,5537680," okay go so it seems to be compiling so but though i don't really think generate the rules is a good name"
5538400,5546400," so what we're generating in here is that okay we look at the pixel uh with a certain neighborhood"
5546400,5555840," all right with a certain neighborhood and um yeah i don't know so maybe it's something like a melt down"
5556480,5561520," right so it's called melted down uh and this one is going to melt down"
5561520,5570080," cool so let's create a separate function for a different way of generating uh generating this entire"
5570080,5580560," stuff right uh so we're going to call it uh cycle rules right cycle rules and uh we are accepting the same"
5580560,5586000," things in here we're accepting the board and automaton right so let's start iterating the board all right"
5586000,5592720," we're going to iterate by rows uh less than board height plus plus y then we're going to be iterating the"
5592720,5602320," columns uh x x width x uh there we go and in here we get x and y so this is this specific cell"
5602960,5610080," uh we may want to take the neighborhood uh right so the way we take the neighborhood is we provide"
5610080,5616560," the board the amount of states we have that's important and the current cell and that gives us the"
5616560,5627200," neighborhood key uh right that gives us the neighborhood key uh and we need to now have some sort of a table"
5627200,5634160," right have some sort of a table so maybe it's going to be um"
5634160,5647440," um neighbors uh neighbors states neighbor states right and it's going to be an object that uses key"
5647440,5654480," basically the neighboring key as the thing and the value is going to be i suppose the all the colors that"
5654480,5659920," we encounter there all right so let's actually say that this is going to be an array actually their"
5659920,5664320," states right so that means it's going to be number the array of numbers right and initially we're going"
5664320,5671440," to initialize this into i think with an empty object uh okay so now so it's sort of like an inverse map"
5671440,5677440," right isn't it i don't i don't know maybe maybe it is we'll see uh neighbors and neighbor states"
5679200,5686880," all right all right and we need to check do we have anything in this neighbors do we have anything in"
5686880,5693760," this neighbors and if we don't uh we need to initialize that with an empty array which allows us"
5693760,5702800," then essentially push board get x and y right so we essentially associate neighborhood with that specific"
5702800,5712160," core uh and at the end of this entire stuff we will essentially get uh right the um what is it called"
5712160,5719520," the object which we can work with right we can get the object that we can work with um so that we don't"
5719520,5724160," really generate the rules yet we don't really generate the rules yet uh because that will require"
5724160,5731120," going through this thing and just um you know adjusting everything right so this is a cute board uh this"
5731120,5738240," is a cute automaton and there we go right so let me recompile this in there i think so we've got some"
5738240,5744720," subs um so i i think i didn't acknowledge them uh ninosaur i think i already acknowledge you a lifelong"
5744720,5749840," learner thank you so much for twitch prime with the message thanks for having fun with us you're welcome"
5749840,5755120," i suppose thanks for for watching uh uc10 thank you so much for tier one subscription thank you thank you"
5755120,5764560," thank you um all right so i think i'm in the wrong place all right all right all right all right all right"
5764560,5772720," uh okay so uh the reason why i want to run it right now because i want to take a look at the log"
5772720,5779440," and i hope to see the actual table that uh give us the insight into what is going on yeah there we go"
5780160,5787360," so uh let's you know unfold it and here they are right so basically with this specific neighborhood"
5787360,5795120," we'd have things like this right so and as you can see we have repeating things in here and um i suppose"
5795120,5802480," one way to combat that uh would be probably uh use the sets right it would be better to use the sets"
5803120,5809760," uh so maybe maybe that's precisely what i'm gonna do in here in fact all right so what if i replace"
5809760,5814560," this entire thing with the set of numbers what kind of things do we have for the sets uh you can append"
5814560,5820720," you can delete clear you can do for each uh that sounds good actually so here maybe i can just do set"
5820720,5828640," number new uh and instead of push we do add i think that's how it works uh so let me see if it's"
5828640,5836320," going to work or not so javascript has literally sets it's not powers it's not powers i think it's"
5836320,5841440," pretty freaking powers uh it even displays the different sets and stuff like that there we go"
5841440,5847360," so now we have unique scores and yeah so we can create a thing that cycles through that right so if"
5847360,5854080," you have this neighborhood it's going to cycle through these things it's pretty cool i guess maybe"
5855360,5863600," uh so that was relatively easy to to actually build i think so okay we've got that uh so the next thing"
5863600,5870400," is going to be like iterating through all of these things and actually um and actually building the the"
5870400,5877360," rules it's like lists uh yeah i mean it's a type script right so essentially in type script you can"
5877360,5885120," define types with generics right so this is a generic so type script is like a java but for for javascript"
5885360,5901360," um so yes yes okay let's iterate through all of that i want to iterate through i suppose the keys"
5901360,5908800," all right so we're gonna have neighbors uh neighbor of object keys of the neighbor states all right there we"
5908800,5915680," go so this is the neighbor uh and write and for the for that specific neighbor uh we're getting"
5915680,5922160," the states right so this is going to be the states uh and what we need to do we need to iterate through"
5922160,5929120," them right so uh i think set had for each yeah it has a for each so that means we can just do"
5930080,5937200," states for each uh states for each uh state right so this is the state uh there we go"
5937200,5948800," and what we want to do right for cute automaton cute automaton at the state state right at the state state"
5948800,5956720," um in the neighborhood so and we can take a look at these transitions right so in the neighborhood is this"
5956720,5960800," thing we have to transition to the next one we have to transition to the next one"
5960800,5969360," we have to transition to the next one but this is not particularly convenient because"
5969360,5972160," i can not take the neighbor of this thing"
5972160,5986560," unfortunately so uh how can i convert this state uh the uh set to uh to to to list let's go back"
5986560,5992160," to this liar right god damn liar"
5992160,6004320," all right so how do i convert uh set to um array in javascript"
6004320,6013040," hello hello array from okay thank you i don't need to actually read the rest"
6013680,6020720," i just remember that it is a thing array from yeah yeah so array like so it means i can do um array"
6020720,6029520," from yeah it would be kind of nice if like this kind of chat systems actually had some preferences"
6029520,6036800," and the or maybe something similar to i feel lucky like in google so make it respond with like a single"
6036800,6042240," sentence like i asked how do i convert and it would answer array from and that's it and it would shut up"
6042240,6048560," that would have been perfect actually don't you think that would be kind of cool it was just like"
6048560,6052880," a chat system that doesn't explain your shit specifically for programmers just how do i do that"
6052880,6059520," just the array from and that's it and only when i ask what is that only then go and explain what the"
6059520,6067120," fuck it is right uh right you can probably prompt it to do that which will it will forget in in two messages"
6067120,6081920," yeah so uh so uh let me see uh we're gonna have something like this so this is the states uh so that"
6081920,6088160," means i can yeah i can just probably do something like this and uh what we're gonna be doing here let i"
6089600,6101760," state's length uh plus right so the first state uh is going to be state one uh states i the second state"
6101760,6114240," is going to be plus one but mod states length so it will wrap around it will wrap around it's not"
6114240,6123760," polars i think it's pretty freaking pose so that means in here if uh i am in a state one encounter"
6123760,6132160," the neighborhood and bor i switch to state two that's it so that's how we're going to be generating the rules"
6132160,6140960," so we connected all of the states with the same neighborhood then we iterated through that one more time"
6140960,6146400," right and uh we just iterated the states and if in the state one we encounter this neighborhood we"
6146400,6152640," switch to state two and since we're iterating by pairs if we're in the state two and we like see this"
6152640,6158080," the same neighborhood we switch to state three and so on and so forth and in here we're gonna wrap around"
6158080,6167600," from the last state to the first one uh right so that's pretty poggers i think so we're cycling through"
6167600,6174400," and let's actually do console log uh cute automaton and see what kind of stuff it generated i should"
6174400,6180960," probably rename uh get rid of the like prefix cute right because we're not only using cute people"
6180960,6184960," in here right so it could be any images in here so we have to kind of abstract away from"
6184960,6192000," from this kind of stuff but anyway uh so what we have in here uh 218 did i forget to"
6192800,6196480," recompile i think it successfully compiled but we have a runtime error"
6196480,6203600," yeah i didn't compile it properly uh so what you don't like about that"
6203600,6207760," what's wrong with that can you can't find name state"
6207760,6222400," all right so what we have in here so it's a ton"
6227600,6231760," what's the termination step is there any why do you need the termination state the show must go on"
6231760,6236880," uh all right so let's refresh this into i think and we've got some stuff in here"
6236880,6242320," let's take a look okay so this is one of the states let's take a look at the state five"
6242320,6246800," uh what kind of transition that's actually kind of interesting that's a lot of transition if you"
6246800,6253360," if you ask me all right so in these specific transitions we actually stay at state five uh the"
6253360,6257440," default one what what's the default one i can't see the default one is zero"
6257440,6264720," maybe we should set the default one to be the same as this state maybe that's one of the things we"
6264720,6270240," have to do right but sometimes as you can see you may switch to eight right if you have this"
6270240,6276160," specific neighborhood while being in the state you will switch to eight um it's doing some things"
6276720,6281200," we're doing some things okay so let's take a look at some other things in here"
6281200,6290080," uh so when we are in eight we can switch back to five sometimes to ten sometimes two so as you can"
6290080,6294640," see we have some transitions in here i've just got an idea"
6298000,6306160," what if is there any theory on non-deterministic cell automaton because this entire thing is"
6306160,6311680," deterministic right having a certain state of the cell and certain neighborhood you guarantee to switch"
6311680,6318960," to the that specific state can you have okay i'm in that state i have this neighborhood but instead of"
6318960,6326080," 100 switching to that other state what if i had a table of probabilities of switching to different states"
6328000,6336080," you can build up that table based on statistics of several images and then you put uh softmax on them"
6336080,6342800," and just like randomly pick yo what the fuck is there any like a theory on this kind of automaton so i"
6342800,6346080," don't know i'm not a computer scientist and you know um"
6351200,6359120," like randomized automaton yeah randomized automaton it's actually very interesting i don't know i'll"
6359120,6366560," need to explore that idea because you can based that probability on some statistics that you collected"
6366560,6375520," on some on several images right um so and that basically turns into mark of chains actually if you think"
6375520,6384800," about it yeah that's basically marker chains uh right okay so we've got this thing that's supposed to"
6384800,6389760," circle around right so it's supposed to circle around right now we don't run anything let's"
6389760,6391840," compute the next state of this entire thing"
6396800,6409200," okay"
6409200,6418400," that's kind of cool it doesn't really really disappear though okay what if i just try to play this thing"
6421280,6427440," well i mean that's kind of cool though they're yo what the fuck that's cool"
6427440,6437520," i don't like that uh wait a second what if i do that trick with four and three all right so what"
6437520,6448320," if i have only a single one in there that's so cool i don't like that okay so we have this next yo"
6449600,6450560," it's a cyclo"
6450560,6458640," what the fuck this is so fun yo"
6458640,6470640," what the fuck and then it just disappears right it's kind of surprising that"
6472160,6480000," yeah it just disappears but that's fine that's kind of funny right yeah it's a ai art yeah yeah"
6480000,6482000," that's what it is it's a ai art um"
6482000,6489040," yo why is it so fun i don't understand what's interesting is that i don't have any particular"
6489040,6496000," goal i'm just around right so it's fun right i think i'm going crazy is that what is that the"
6496000,6500800," definition of insanity i think that's the definition of insanity that's for sure uh yeah"
6500800,6505840," okay so let's actually try uh some other uh other"
6505840,6510800," cellular attempt of images and cellular automaton but images let's take a look at the couple"
6510800,6511680," right"
6511680,6519360," uh definitely favors black but this is because of the outline we have too many combinations of outline i"
6519360,6536320," uh so yeah so essentially there's too many combinations of this like a black outline color"
6536320,6545840," uh and because of that it's very stable right it is very stable uh there's not that many like of green or"
6545840,6551440," blue or red combinations and that's why they're not that stable uh but there is a lot of example for"
6551440,6559840," for the outline so this is my hypothesis at least all right so here's the cup uh so let's see what it"
6559840,6566720," will turn into if we do something like this it doesn't really turn into anything so if i play"
6566720,6572960," uh it doesn't do anything and it just disappears probably because there's too many states in here"
6572960,6580000," right yeah there's too many states if we uh right look at all of these states it's just like doesn't"
6580000,6586960," have enough combinations to be stable or interesting so i don't think kappa is that useful for our specific"
6586960,6591360," case so let's take a look at sodium pogue all right let's take a look at certain ball"
6591360,6598880," is the black the default to zero no no it's not default the default to zero i think it's transparent"
6599920,6608240," uh all right so we have sodium a pug so there's also yeah there's also too many combinations in here i"
6608240,6620000," don't think it will anything useful yeah though yeah it ends up being like devouring this entire thing as"
6620000,6630080," well right yeah i think the most interesting one was the cute people because it's a very simplistic pixel"
6630080,6638480," art right it's a very simplistic pixel art um yeah we could probably pre-process the image to actually"
6638480,6643760," reduce the amount of colors so one of the things we could do for sure uh just to to have some interesting"
6643760,6650640," stuff but this one is so cool right uh so a cool thing is that now i can just draw"
6650640,6657440," some stuff in here to get some interesting stuff maybe right and let's take a look at that and it"
6657440,6669760," just disappears very quickly yeah this one is cool all right so uh let me see so this is just a cyclic"
6669760,6676800," rules there was another interesting idea suggested i think by kolumbetka uh on the break uh maybe a cell"
6677520,6685120," could copy the state of its neighbor this is a very interesting uh actually approach uh essentially"
6685120,6691440," for each individual cell right so we look at the cell at the current cell and its neighborhood"
6691440,6698080," right we look at the current cell in its neighborhood and we're switching to the um"
6698720,6705120," to the state that has the most frequency if you know what i mean but that raises the question okay so"
6705120,6713120," what if i have uh cell a with one neighborhood and the same cell a with a different neighborhood like"
6713120,6718160," to which i switch because the different neighborhoods may have different frequencies like how do we decide"
6718160,6724960," we can just sum up the the neighborhoods right the frequencies of the neighborhoods and switch to the"
6726320,6732560," uh to the most frequent when like we sum up all of the neighborhoods does it make sense uh we can try"
6732560,6739200," something like that and see what kind of like seller automaton that will generate um sounds interesting"
6739200,6748560," just cycle through now we already did cycling through like i don't see how we can cycle through here"
6748560,6755520," uh and well yeah in that case some can be more than eight but we're not going to be using some as a"
6756320,6762720," um as a key in the transition table we're using it only just to make a decision on on the rule"
6762720,6772560," uh right so we're only making a decision in the rule so i think that's going to be fine i think okay"
6772560,6780400," let's give it a try so uh we have a cycle rules uh let's call this thing a frack rules right frack rules"
6780400,6790240," uh we're gonna accept the board and automaton right there we go so let's go uh let's start iterating"
6790240,6796080," uh by rows of course so this is going to be by rules board uh height plus plus y"
6798960,6810160," x uh width x uh width x uh okay so then i do board uh i think i need to do count neighbors right so"
6810160,6817040," what do we have in here we have this kind of thing so we take the board the amount of states is the"
6817040,6827520," automaton length and we just put x and y in here that gives us the neighborhoods uh right so this is the"
6827520,6834080," neighborhood so one of the things we probably have to have is the map that maps the state"
6834080,6839680," to all its neighborhoods right so because we we just need to collect all of the neighborhoods so here's"
6839680,6845680," the interesting thing here we had a map from neighborhood to the states but this one is an"
6845680,6853120," opposite we need a map from states to the set of neighborhoods or rather maybe list of neighborhoods"
6853840,6859520," right something like that it's the other way around right i mean a neighborhood is actually a string"
6859520,6865360," right so neighborhood is actually a string that's kind of interesting uh so this one is called neighbor"
6865360,6875680," states and here we have states uh states neighbors state neighbors uh state neighbors uh so this one could be"
6876480,6886080," something like this all right so let me let me see let me see so this one is going to be just new uh state"
6886080,6887360," numbers and there we go"
6887360,6896720," so how are we going to be doing all of that so the reason why i'm using map is that because the javascript"
6896720,6902800," objects do not allow to use numbers as the keys it will automatically convert them to strings anyway"
6902800,6920160," all right so uh let me let me see so how do you use map can you check if a particular key exists there okay"
6920160,6928800," so there is a has so you can check whether it has a particular uh a particular key state neighbors has um"
6928800,6937440," has the states right so maybe because of that we have to do something like state board get x and y"
6937440,6945840," right so we've got x and y uh all right all right all right so and what we need to check we need to check"
6945840,6959680," whether we have this state right if we do have this state what we do uh right we just um get that state"
6959680,6961520," though interestingly"
6961520,6974720," i suppose get may return undefined yeah it can return defined all right"
6975840,6983520," all right all right all right so that means here we get neighbors all right there we go so we get"
6983520,6991040," neighbors and this is where you can check if neighbors is undefined right if neighbors is undefined"
6991040,7003040," maybe it makes sense to set neighbors to new array we're setting it to new array then state neighbors"
7005440,7016880," add how do you do add the set i suppose uh where am i okay set state to neighbors and then just do"
7016880,7025680," neighbors push there we go so first we're checking does that thing exist within that if not we're just"
7025680,7031360," creating and i basically expect that arrays are passed by a reference so this is sort of like a reference"
7031360,7037360," value right right so this is basically what i expect in here so okay let's take a look at the intermediate"
7037360,7043600," state and see what we gathered for that specific image i'm sorry excuse me"
7043600,7056800," so this is a cycle um freck rules excuse me um so cute board cute automaton"
7058560,7061040," uh cute board cute automaton"
7061040,7066800," so let's take a look at the compilation errors"
7066800,7080560," okay and let's refresh this entire stuff so we've got some stuff look at that um"
7081680,7086720," do we really have that many of these things what the bug are you telling me"
7086720,7093520," one thousand okay that's one mention do we really have to do the"
7093520,7097440," huh"
7097440,7107120," that's actually a lot so that specific this is probably black pixel right yeah it is a black pixel i'm pretty"
7107120,7112640," sure and this is all of the neighborhoods it was seen in"
7112640,7122480," so and do we want to sum up all of these things i think we do maybe i think it makes sense"
7122480,7129920," i think it does make sense though how are we going to be summing up all that right so if i have a string"
7129920,7136960," right so let me actually explore so if i have a string which contains numbers right uh so how can i get"
7136960,7143360," uh the length of this okay so i can get the length of the string sure so that means i can iterate this"
7143360,7159040," uh length uh console log uh s i is that a thing i can do okay cool uh but then i want to turn it into a number"
7159040,7171360," uh okay so there should be a way javascript string to number"
7171360,7177120," uh"
7177120,7181520," parse int okay uh i can do that"
7181520,7184320," parse int"
7184320,7191840," that makes it super easy right so you can just iterate them and then just parse int and there you go"
7191840,7198720," uh i lost memory now you're welcome uh so"
7201360,7213200," we will need the following thing okay let's start iterating all of that stuff"
7213200,7223920," all of that stuff can iterate map with forage yeah i can that's cool so um state neighbors for each but the"
7223920,7233120," question is where the question is where is the okay so the first one is a value uh which is the states and the um key is the neighbor it's a neighborhood in here right there we go"
7235200,7240640," um so that means for that specific"
7240640,7252960," oh i'm an idiot no no no no no the first one is a value which means it's neighbors and this is this state okay"
7252960,7262720," oh god okay so i need to create an array of the neighborhood frequencies so that means i need to create an array"
7262720,7276800," um of the size of automaton length of the size of automaton length and fill it with zero right and that will create the neighbors"
7277760,7284320," frequencies i suppose i suppose right so the neighbors frequencies the next thing i need to do i need to iterate"
7284320,7290880," through each individual neighbor of neighbors right then i need to iterate"
7290880,7298080," i suppose since the states uh we know precisely the amount of states i need to iterate through zero to"
7298080,7303920," automaton length right and what i can do now is just basically neighbors"
7304880,7310160," frequencies frequencies i plus neighbor i but parse int"
7310160,7313840," yo okay"
7313840,7325600," so the next thing i need to do is that i need to find the index of the maximum frequency"
7329040,7330160," um right"
7330160,7342720," so but how can i even do that right so uh i can do max i can find the maximum value but i need an index"
7342720,7353040," of the maximum value i need an index of the maximum value uh which makes it kind of nah okay so we can have"
7353040,7362000," something like index uh right which is going to be undefined for now right and the max value right max value"
7362000,7367600," so we're going to be iterating through uh all the states all right so we have all the states in here"
7375600,7381280," you know i think i think i'm an idiot this is not how we're supposed to do that um"
7381280,7386640," yeah this is not how i'm supposed to do that then yeah"
7386640,7389520," um"
7389520,7398560," this is completely wrong right because i need a specific neighborhood right if i"
7399280,7402320," right so i have a automaton some sort of automaton"
7402320,7411920," and i'm in in a specific state to transition i need a specific neighborhood key in here"
7411920,7419200," and what kind of neighborhood key i have in here i have nothing so i don't even need"
7419200,7426800," any statistics in here that's what's funny i don't even need any statistics what i need to do"
7426800,7432960," is for each state generate all of the possible neighborhood keys"
7432960,7440320," and for all of the possible neighborhood keys i need to switch to the most probable state"
7440320,7447680," what's funny is that because of that this sort of approach means that i don't need the board so this"
7447680,7454080," kind of stuff can be generated just using automaton right and it has nothing to do with it's not based"
7454080,7459920," on the images themselves it's not based on the images themselves but rather on the amount of states"
7459920,7465200," right so it's based on the amount of states purity"
7465200,7468080," yeah"
7468080,7474000," we can try that that that could actually create a very interesting truth"
7475600,7482320," though generating all of the possible neighborhoods is also a very interesting problem right because"
7482320,7487760," you have to do that recursively right so you literally have to do the recursively"
7487760,7493600," um yeah so let's actually scrap this entire function so this is not how i want to do that"
7493600,7494960," right so this is not how it goes"
7497600,7502480," and by the way this entire thing should not accept the board right it has nothing to do with the board"
7502480,7510160," it's just purely based on the states it's just purely based on the states i'm already streaming for two"
7510160,7516080," and a half of an hour my guts and i'm already tired uh and i need to make a small break to continue with this idea"
7517920,7525040," uh all right i need to make a small break to continue with this idea so maybe i should go for a break"
7525040,7531680," uh or maybe i should not go for a break uh let's actually go for a break um"
7531680,7538720," all right so we need to generate all the plausible neighborhoods"
7539520,7545760," how can we freaking do that so the thing about neighborhoods is that they always have to adapt"
7545760,7553760," um to eight right there's only eight neighbors so can we uh have some sort of like additional"
7553760,7563920," example in here all right so so create neighbors js uh console log right so hello seaman"
7566320,7578080," node neighbors uh neighbors uh hello seaman so uh let's say that i want to i have only how many states"
7578080,7585120," uh i have only one state right so in that case the only possible neighborhood is going to be just"
7585120,7594480," eight right so yeah so you can have only one uh one state and for each cell you have eight of the same"
7594480,7601920," states right let's imagine that you have two states now right you have two states now uh how many um"
7601920,7607840," you know plausible neighborhoods you can have let's actually brute force them literally uh right so you"
7607840,7615200," have um the first state right so what's actually called maybe a uh and a iterates from zero to"
7615200,7622800," uh to eight right so it might be equal to eight as well right plus plus a uh right and the second state is"
7622800,7631840," going to be b uh right so essentially what we want to say if a plus b exactly equal to eight that's a"
7631840,7637280," plausible neighborhood that we may have right and we're going to just print it right i'm going to"
7637280,7645280," simply print it so this is going to be a uh and b so uh let's go so these are plausible neighborhoods"
7645280,7651760," all of them add up to eight so if you have two states you may have three of the first state and five of the"
7651760,7656480," second state right you're never going to have three and four because they don't add up to eight"
7656480,7661760," uh right you can have four and four and so on and so forth so effectively if you have two states you may"
7661760,7670000," have nine possible neighborhoods right and this is what the uh binary string basically means uh if you"
7670000,7674320," see in the neighborhood is a string or not binary string a number string this is what it is right if we"
7674320,7680720," join uh this thing like that uh that's basically the neighborhood key right the amount of characters"
7680720,7687440," the neighborhood key is the uh amount of states in here so that's basically what it is right if you have"
7687440,7693760," three states for instance all right so we're going to have c in here uh and then uh do something like this"
7695040,7702240," and see so how many of them we're going to have so these are all of the possible neighborhoods uh in that"
7702240,7714560," specific case we have uh 45 right so in case of uh one state we can have only one uh neighborhood key"
7714560,7722960," which is eight uh in case of the two we can have only nine in case of the three you can have 45 right"
7722960,7734080," so i think it's 45 uh yeah 45 45 uh so what do we have four of them right something like this"
7735920,7743440," so it's actually very easy to add them up right so uh you just add additional you know four loop to"
7743440,7751040," generate this kind of thing so in case of the four how many of them are we going to have uh right so"
7751040,7761440," let me see it's 165 right 165 which forms a very interesting sequence like what the hell is one nine"
7761440,7774800," 45 45 45 45 so there is a very interesting website actually uh um database of uh number sequences"
7774800,7787440," database of number sequences it's called uh oh yeah dot org that's literally how it is pronounced right so"
7787440,7793040," online encyclopedia of integer sequences uh let's take a look at it so the cool thing about this website"
7793040,7798880," is that you can put uh any sequence in there and it will search it and it will tell you what is this"
7798880,7809680," sequence so the next uh value is supposed to be a 495 right and this thing is a figure figure eight"
7809680,7812960," number based on eight dimensional regular simplex"
7815440,7821680," isn't that interesting so it's a oh it's a binomial coefficient with eight so it's a binomial coefficient"
7821680,7828320," with that what's interesting is that if we add another state in here uh theoretically we should"
7828320,7838160," have uh 495 right so let's actually give it a try so e e plus e this is going to be e"
7838160,7844880," and something like this okay so we have five states in here now right how many of them do we have"
7846160,7846640," look at that"
7846640,7858560," it is true right so this kind of website is really cool for finding uh different like relationships"
7858560,7864560," between different processes and stuff like that right so and uh it already says that it's basically"
7864560,7870000," a binomial coefficient right so this is basically a binomial coefficient uh and binomial coefficient"
7870000,7876880," actually describes the the pascal triangle if i'm not mistaken right so essentially uh binomial coefficient"
7876880,7883520," has two uh variables right and one of them describes the like a row or column or something like that i don't"
7883520,7891200," quite remember but if we try to google up uh pascal uh triangle right so the pascal triangle"
7893280,7898880," uh let's actually find a big one uh let's actually find a big one uh is there any like a big one"
7898880,7904560," really really big one yeah i don't know i think that one is good um"
7907360,7918800," oh yeah here it is look at that so this diagonal one nine 45 165 to 495 right so it's basically binomial"
7918800,7923760," coefficient it's that specific diagonal on a pascal triangle"
7923760,7932960," is that cool right it's like you wouldn't expect that these things somehow related to like binomial"
7932960,7938400," coefficient or something like that by the way i knew that up front because i was researching to"
7938400,7944640," how to do like different representations of these sparse matrix for transition tables and i was just"
7944640,7950480," like seeing can i predict the amount of states that i need and what's the formula that predicts the"
7950480,7955440," amount of states and this is what i discovered it's it's literally binomial coefficient uh right"
7955440,7960480," it's just like something that i wanted to to demonstrate and show i think it's kind of"
7960480,7965360," interesting not sure how useful this is going to be going to be for us but i think it's kind of cool"
7965360,7970080," so that's pretty poggers"
7970080,7978080," i like how it looks accidental yeah it does look accidental but at the same time i think it"
7978080,7986480," kind of makes sense as well i think um oh yeah so what i was doing right so essentially the the reason why"
7986480,7991040," uh i need all of that i need to generate all of the possible um"
7991040,7999840," all of the possible neighborhoods so and since um the amount of states may vary"
7999840,8010240," uh the amount of nested loops may vary as well right so essentially we have a variable not variable not"
8010240,8017440," amount of iterations but actually the amount of nested loops so the amount of nested loops is the variable"
8017440,8026560," that we have right so if i have five states i literally have to have four uh like five for like nested for"
8026560,8036560," loops how can you achieve variable amount of nested loops well one of the things you can do is uh you can"
8036560,8043920," watch one of my videos on the topic right so let's actually find out what's actually find this kind of"
8043920,8047040," thing uh let's wait until youtube actually loads it"
8048880,8062560," uh okay uh sojin uh infinite nested loops i literally have a video on that"
8062560,8072560," uh infinitely nested loops that's a title i'm really proud of like it's just such a cool title look at that"
8072640,8086080," you want like by the way uh small uh behind the scenes so essentially uh the ratio between the size of"
8086080,8093600," outer loop and inner loop is a golden ratio right no joke really so basically i did that in inkscape"
8093600,8100080," and i took width and height of the of this thing and i multiplied it by a golden ratio actually inverse"
8100080,8105440," of the golden ratio which is 0.6 something something and it got this thing and it fit perfectly inside"
8105440,8110000," and then they multiply it again and again and again and that's why it looks so good because this is"
8110000,8115920," literally a golden ratio like literally golden ratio like it literally took the the constant and multiply"
8115920,8124320," the size so um yeah so essentially um i in this specific video i describe that you can achieve"
8124320,8130400," infinitely in this loop through recursion recursion right because it's a you basically have a for loop"
8130400,8136560," and in in the for loop you recursively call itself and it infinitely nests the loops uh right so you can"
8136560,8142800," watch the video in here right so i'm going to copy paste it in in here and uh i'm going to also put"
8142800,8153360," that in description for people who maybe eventually watch that on youtube uh infinitely nested uh loops"
8153360,8159920," right this one's it it's it's a very short video it's more of like it's something in between of a small"
8159920,8168480," educational video and a chat post in fact i kind of intended it as a chat post right it's it's it feels like a"
8168480,8174320," chat post but at the same time it has some interesting uh food for thoughts right so"
8174320,8180240," it's an educational chat post that's what i like to call it"
8180240,8192560," right education through chat posts i think it's a pretty effective way of educating people in my opinion"
8193440,8199680," anyways anyways anyways so uh let's actually create a function right so recursive function that is going"
8199680,8208560," to be generating neighborhoods all right so and in here i suppose we're going to be um generating the"
8208560,8214320," states right so here we accept the state uh since this is a javascript it's not typescript i cannot"
8214320,8221840," provide the uh provide the uh provide the types it really is keg w so it does feel like a post but at"
8221840,8229200," the same time it is educational isn't it because it allows you to look at the recursion from a different"
8229200,8236800," angle right so because i've actually seen people telling me that they never thought about recursion as"
8236800,8241760," infinitely nested loose but this is one way to look at recursion right so it's a variable way of"
8242560,8252320," of nesting loops right so and the shared postiness of this video comes from the fact that uh a lot of"
8252320,8258800," people think that like a lot of nested loops is a bad idea right and i'm actively encouraging something"
8258800,8264640," bad right i actively encouraging i'm saying that nested loops is good nest as many loops as you want"
8264640,8270800," in fact you can have like infinite nested loops and this is where educational value comes in right it"
8270800,8277840," basically offers a different perspective on recursion so it's a ship post but the ship post with a twist"
8277840,8280160," that actually expands your mind"
8280160,8286640," that's the content i subscribe for"
8286640,8291600," that's what sodium project is all about"
8292800,8297680," so right we've got some stuff thank you so much uh nevus 100 and one thought which brand thank you"
8297680,8300160," thank you thank you uh right"
8300160,8305440," so yeah"
8305440,8314720," and by the way when i post my videos i really do actually and ironically thinks about things like that"
8314720,8323440," right so my perfect content is a absolute shed post that uh triggers people because it promotes some"
8323440,8329440," controversial idea of uh you know nested a lot of loops but at the same time it offers a different"
8329440,8335360," perspective that lets you look at things from a different angle that's the content i like to produce"
8335360,8343200," like this is content i'm striving for controversial shed posting but at the same time education yes"
8343200,8348480," that's what they like it's really difficult to produce such content to be fair right so it's really"
8348480,8354560," hard to find this balance between education and shed posts and sometimes my content is too"
8354560,8359120," educational become boring and sometimes it's too shed post people thinking i'm insane"
8359680,8364960," so striking that balance balance is actually really hard um"
8364960,8372560," all right"
8372560,8383360," so what i want you to do in here right so we are if the amount of states that uh we want to generate"
8383360,8387200," neighbors for right so we're trying to generate the neighbors for that specific state right"
8388640,8395440," if the amount of states we offered to generate for is equal to zero or even worse less than zero we say"
8395440,8404640," fuck you and we go out of the recursion right so if it's greater than zero what we do we do iteration"
8404640,8414880," let a zero less than eight plus plus a uh right and essentially what we have to do we have to call"
8414880,8422800," neighbors one more time with a state minus one and that what ultimately creates an infinite nested loop"
8422800,8429920," right so if we try to do neighbors uh for example zero you instant get fuck you and bail out if you have"
8429920,8438080," one this entire thing is going to be replaced with just this infinite nested loop but with neighbors equal zero"
8438080,8446560," for which it essentially will just do nothing if you put two in here you actually uh increase the amount of"
8446560,8454960," nested loops like so uh right now we have two so the amount of nested loops is how like what kind of"
8454960,8458880," numbers you put in here you put three in here you're gonna have three nested loops and so on and so forth"
8458880,8467600," um okay"
8467600,8479600," so but here's an interesting thing uh when we have to check this specific condition"
8480800,8486880," when do we have to check this specific condition uh we have to check it when the state is equal to zero"
8486880,8494160," or one right so this is where we have to check all of that condition but to check that condition we have"
8494160,8500160," to have an access to all of the previous uh iterators that we had in the recursion right so we have to"
8500160,8508240," have an access to a and then nested a and so on and so forth the question is uh how can we access them"
8508240,8511200," so that's a very very interesting question i think"
8511200,8520400," um so we can try to maybe push them into the uh in in here right so essentially we're gonna have the"
8520400,8529680," um i don't know so access right so this is the access and we're iterating uh x like that all right and"
8530800,8540960," essentially as we go further right so i just do push uh x then i pass it further uh right and then"
8540960,8547040," when i'm done with that specific thing i think i need to pop it out uh right and i'm not sure if"
8547040,8552560," that's how it works in node.js is that how it works in node.js i don't know right if i have something like"
8552560,8559360," uh like this right so this is just an array and i push a 69 into that array and i've got"
8559360,8567280," a 69 and then if i do pop does it pop it out it does in fact pop it out isn't that pogue it's"
8567280,8574720," literally a stack so we've got a sub from k mode 9 thank you so much for uh tier one subscription with"
8574720,8581120," the message sodding a poging thank you thank you so much i'm also poging right now can't stop poging"
8582400,8589120," all right so that's pretty cool uh so that means here as we iterate through all these choices we do"
8589120,8595520," have uh these things and it should be super easy to sum up all these numbers is there anything like"
8595520,8601600," uh some in here okay so there's nothing like that javascript some numbers"
8601600,8614000," array of numbers oh you can use reduce wait a second you can have reduced right"
8616080,8627120," reduce uh a b a plus b is that what i can do oh yeah okay so let me double check uh let me double check yeah"
8629200,8643440," okay you can use that uh so access uh reduce uh a b a plus b and this is where we can check if"
8643440,8651680," this entire stuff is equal to eight that's the thing we care for that's the thing we care for"
8652480,8661120," uh so we can actually so this one iterates like the whole space of these things we can implement"
8661120,8671120," some sort of um optimization that doesn't go deeper in the recursion if uh the current state is already"
8671120,8676640," greater than eight or equal than eight and stuff like that so there is a lot of like uh ways we can"
8676640,8681280," optimize that but i'm not sure if i care about it right now so if this entire thing is equal to eight"
8681280,8687600," that means i can just like go ahead and literally print this entire thing uh like access um right"
8687600,8694560," if i if it's not i just ignore it right and uh we just continue and that should be it i think so that"
8694560,8699760," should effectively implement everything we want right so this one's going to be neighbors uh let's start"
8699760,8706400," with zero so this thing should not print uh anything and it doesn't even work um so what does it say"
8708400,8713680," uh cannot uh read properties uh reduce of undefined and this is because we have to put this thing in"
8713680,8721360," here i suppose uh reduce of empty array with no initial value okay so do i have to provide uh where"
8721360,8727360," do i provide the initial value do i provide it afterwards uh yeah i do provide it afterwards"
8727360,8734800," okay so uh hello seaman we do have hello seaman so in this specific case we get nothing if i put one in"
8734800,8741360," here if i put one in here if i put one in here there's only one neighboring key if i put two in here"
8741360,8753920," uh there should be um nine of them right i put three now we have this many of them 45 it is 45 i can do now"
8753920,8762800," four uh right and it is in fact 165 right so this is five as you can see it's super easy to add additional"
8762800,8769920," sort of um sort of things right so i had five nested loops but since i don't have any nested loops anymore"
8769920,8777120," it's super easy for me to add the sixth one it's just i just increment the number right so i used to like"
8777120,8782720," manually add those nested loops now i didn't have to because i i do that through recursion right so"
8782720,8787920," that's how it works so that's a very good demonstration of like uh usefulness of recursion"
8787920,8796160," i think so the next number is 100 uh 1287 which raises the question yeah it is look at it so"
8797120,8803600," and the next one is going to be 3003 uh we can also check that right so it's going to be seven uh let's"
8803600,8813120," see ah god damn it pretty printing uh all right so let's actually do join uh let's do the join and this"
8813120,8825600," it's gonna be yeah let's do that uh 3003 precisely precisely precisely so what's interesting is that we"
8825600,8832480," can't really easily handle all of this right so we can't really easily handle all this um because"
8832480,8841600," we're just like printing this kind of stuff it would be nice in my opinion if we accepted"
8843120,8850880," sort of like the result in here right what if we accepted the result in here so i would say"
8850880,8857200," result equal to that uh right so i accept the like empty thing in here and then i accept the result"
8857200,8865280," in here and instead of printing this entire thing we would actually push this value to the results"
8865280,8871680," right there we go so in that way after we call this entire recursion we would have"
8872240,8879760," uh result length right so and then we can iterate all that all right then we can iterate all that"
8879760,8890000," so push does not work uh what property of undefined push oh this is because we have to continue"
8890000,8901360," like doing it like so yeah yeah so and uh we basically generate this kind of stuff once we generate all of"
8901360,8906400," the neighbors once and we can reuse that and this is actually super important for us by the way"
8906400,8912880," this is actually super important because uh we need to generate transition rules"
8912880,8923360," um which basically state uh right automaton automaton automaton uh automaton if we are at the state"
8923360,8934080," state and uh we have neighborhood uh transitions uh neighborhood we have to switch to the most frequent"
8934080,8940240," state state state one in that specific neighborhood so that means we're going to keep iterating all of the"
8940240,8946000," possible neighborhoods over and over again for each individual state so that means it's better for us to"
8946000,8951600," generate the least of neighborhoods only once right just generate the least of neighborhoods only once"
8951600,8956560," and just keep reiterating it without like regenerating it over and over again right and we're by the way"
8956560,8962880," generating it very in a very slow way uh right generating like i think 10 is going to take a lot of time"
8962880,8970720," already right so uh let me actually uh yeah so let's look how much time it takes right"
8970720,8975680," is that telecom request no"
8975680,8986240," okay so uh one of the things we can do in here one of the things we can do in here what exactly can we do"
8989120,8996000," uh we can cut off some situations when um i think"
8996000,9004480," is not like when it's already more than eight or some stuff like that so i want to have a"
9004480,9010480," uh shortcut for the sum all right x reduce"
9010480,9016000," right so we want to have something like this"
9017360,9020400," because i don't want to type this specific expression over and over again"
9020400,9022720," i want to just say some and that's it"
9022720,9035120," look how easy this uh so what we can do all right if some access is less or equal than eight"
9035120,9041040," only then we go into the recursion right"
9042720,9045920," only then we go into the recursion so another"
9045920,9050400," well another interesting thing could be actually"
9050400,9058000," yeah so we have we don't have to iterate everything essentially"
9058000,9067040," uh we can subtract some some access yeah that's actually kind of cool"
9068320,9076320," hmm would that be enough actually would that be enough would that be enough um"
9076320,9084720," um that could be so let me maybe do something like this"
9084720,9089760," because uh i don't want to recompute it over and over again"
9091360,9097840," so if state is less or equal than zero uh right we just check for that and we added there and then"
9097840,9106000," we return out of the synthesis um if we have that uh we i think that should work actually"
9106000,9112320," another thing that should work uh a result this is not a result this is a reduce"
9114480,9120960," yo i think it worked but let's actually double check so we can do something like this okay uh i can do"
9120960,9130480," zero uh up until 10 all right um but that also means that we have to clean it up so we can we can do"
9130480,9134640," something like this uh all right and we can say i length"
9138720,9148720," okay"
9148720,9158000," and oh i see jesus christ okay all right and that looks like the the right uh the right thing right"
9158000,9164400," so this is the right sequence but it's much faster actually it's actually much faster uh all right so 11"
9165760,9168640," 12 what about 20"
9168640,9172320," i mean it's still slow"
9172320,9182560," yeah we will we probably won't be able to use anything but the cute people pixel art right so"
9182560,9190240," we probably won't be able to use any of that so we'll get this up uh from techno f uh 33 l i i think i"
9190240,9196640," just acknowledge you thank you and came online i acknowledge yeah i remember it uh okay so that's"
9196640,9204960," fine so what if i just have 20 right so just a single 20 how much time single 20 will take for probably a lot"
9204960,9214880," not that many so it generated two million uh neighborhoods about that"
9216560,9222720," uh so that's pretty cool but it was not impossible right and we're going to be generating it only once"
9222720,9228640," right so we're going to be generating it only once uh right so that's poggers in my opinion"
9228640,9235760," um and by the way since i'm calling some only once maybe it makes sense to actually put it like this"
9235760,9240160," right i don't know i don't know i think it's new so it's a self-contained function so to speak"
9240160,9244800," uh more or less um self-contained function"
9244800,9256640," all right so i was thinking can i do stuff like this where i also return the result"
9257440,9268880," uh so then i can do stuff like neighbor i without worrying about this thing right so will that work"
9268880,9278880," for me uh-huh so result length undefined okay i see so this is probably because here i have to return the"
9278880,9288320," result like so i think it works out right so this is very very easy way to define this kind of function"
9288320,9296800," right because upon calling it you create two new two arrays two new arrays two new arrays and then as we"
9296800,9303760," call uh recursively we actually don't create new arrays we reuse the ones that we created uh at here"
9303760,9309680," and that actually kind of syntactically makes it the entire function easier to use look at that that's"
9309680,9318320," actually cool isn't it i think it's cool yo and for this thing i actually want to make like a single"
9318320,9326160," line maybe not i don't know just going for aesthetics already yeah um so"
9329920,9337120," that's poggers in my opinion uh so maybe we should call this thing something like neighbor"
9337120,9340960," neighbors all neighbors"
9340960,9354000," and the function is ready to be copy pasted into the main uh main program right so let's go ahead to uh to"
9354000,9362320," this thing and uh put it in here somewhere so frequency rules i'm gonna put it put it in here"
9362320,9368640," and i think i want to put some um you know types in here right i think it's quite important so this"
9368640,9376000," thing is a number uh this thing is uh array of numbers is it array i think it is array numbers and"
9376000,9381840," this thing is array of strings that's kind of important and what we get is an array of strings"
9382400,9392320," very very very important all right uh so what we can do now uh we can do all neighbors automaton length"
9392320,9397040," right and it gives us all of the neighborhoods neighbors there we go"
9397040,9405200," all the neighbors so now what we have to do for each individual state we have to iterate"
9407520,9413360," for each individual state we have to iterate and switch to the most frequent one"
9413360,9421280," and we need to detect the most frequent one that's the problem here"
9421280,9426960," that's the problem here right so it would be probably nice to do that somewhere in here"
9426960,9433760," in the place where we uh actually add this entire thing to here i think that will make sense so"
9433760,9440480," essentially here we have to iterate all of the uh like all of the axes all of the axes and find the"
9440480,9448880," index of the most frequent one right so that's the problem because um okay is there any function for"
9448880,9455680," that all right is there any function for that so we can ask mr chi to tell us but it probably will just"
9455680,9464400," we will just generate the function from scratch i can generate it myself but um uh how in in javascript"
9464400,9478160," find the index of the biggest value uh of the array is there any standard function for that"
9478160,9492000," uh okay so let me put some stuff in here oh my god this is not i can't see why is it so small okay um"
9494800,9504800," uh no uh need to uh need to implement it for me i can implement it myself thanks"
9504800,9511200," all right because it will probably just oh here is the function it will just generate this kind of thing"
9511200,9512560," uh right"
9516080,9517920," not the biggest index of okay"
9517920,9524960," so you're suggesting to iterate a raid twice"
9524960,9530560," i mean it's probably not gonna be that big"
9530560,9536400," i mean you can do that in one go"
9538640,9541520," that's a dumb way of doing i don't like this way of doing that it's not"
9541520,9545680," well still technically off n i mean"
9545680,9549920," all right"
9549920,9561200," we can do that i suppose sure um since it's probably gonna be like uh around 100 and we're definitely not"
9561200,9568480," gonna have like more than 11 anyway so uh we can use that sure uh so okay"
9568960,9575680," here i want to actually put this thing all right let's see if how it's going to work out"
9575680,9582800," oh right so um what the fuck is this"
9582800,9590160," should"
9590160,9590720," oh i see"
9590720,9592160," uh"
9592160,9603920," yeah yeah yeah so let's actually do something like 10 uh right and console log results"
9606080,9612800," all right all right that's cool nine is it a good one 10k okay"
9612800,9615440," all right"
9615440,9621360," so but that actually means that this function is not"
9625840,9635760," uh this function is not what it claims to be all um all frequent all frequent neighbors"
9635760,9643520," uh or maybe all neighbors freaks that's a better one uh let's go back to here"
9648160,9648720," okay"
9648720,9658800," so what do we have in here is going to be a number so then here we accept the array of numbers and here"
9658800,9666720," is actually array of players so the first one is the string the second one is the index right so"
9666720,9673840," so this is basically what we have in here and uh we're going to get this thing in here"
9673840,9677680," so what i want to try what am i looking at"
9680720,9682880," did i"
9682880,9689680," okay what"
9689680,9695360," so i don't need this thing anymore okay"
9695360,9706080," i feel like what did i remove am i am i going crazy so this is neighbors"
9708560,9713200," uh frack rules i removed frack rules what the"
9713200,9718720," wait a second i removed frack rules accidentally this is important yeah here it is oh my god"
9718720,9725200," all right so let's remove this thing"
9725200,9728240," so let's go back"
9736080,9745760," then this number number number what is it called what did i say it's a string and number and this thing"
9745760,9752160," okay so and then i accept this stuff and that stuff okay cool"
9752160,9763760," uh what i want now is just uh double check if this compiles if it matches the types i'm pretty sure it"
9763760,9768160," should but we'll see okay so uh all neighbor"
9768160,9771920," fricks"
9771920,9787600," okay fricks neighbors fricks"
9790560,9798400," so now this is very important thing okay so we're iterating through all the states uh right automaton"
9798400,9799440," um"
9799440,9807280," length right these are all the states for each individual state automaton being at that specific"
9807280,9812720," state we encounter uh one specific neighborhood can you do something like"
9813360,9821280," neighbor uh"
9821280,9822480," neighbor uh frequency neighbor uh frequency neighbors frequency right"
9822480,9830160," if at state i i encounter neighborhood neighbor i switch to the most frequent one in here that's"
9830160,9836400," what i do that's it so that's the whole thing uh yeah believe it or not that's the whole thing"
9838320,9843440," so iterating through all the neighborhoods right so when we pick the one that is most uh right"
9843440,9849680," the most frequent so let's try to compile this into i think and see"
9849680,9854240," okay so the hell in here"
9854960,9860000," uh it has to be something like off let's see"
9860000,9868560," okay so let me see what we've got"
9868560,9872320," so we are using cute people okay"
9872320,9880720," we create the frequency rules we can try to print them but it may actually take a huge amount of time so"
9880720,9884960," though we're not going to have that many many of them okay so let's actually try to"
9884960,9889200," uh to print them let's try to print them"
9889200,9903360," okay so uh at the state one here are the trends that's a lot of transitions well i mean it's not that"
9903360,9910640," many transitions but it's a lot for the uh yeah for for the poor chromium or for my poor laptop"
9911280,9917040," i literally have to close that page because i cannot display that that's how old my laptop is"
9917040,9925840," it can't display this um so maybe yeah so maybe the whole logic should have been written in"
9925840,9934880," in web assembly all right for my laptop uh anyway uh so let me double check this kind of stuff show me"
9934880,9942640," death tolls please i'm gonna refresh one more time uh and now let's try to compute the next state"
9942640,9950960," and they're basically disappearing"
9950960,9959520," so yeah they end up basically disappearing right if we try to play this kind of thing but it's it's actually"
9959520,9963360," kind of cooler they're disappearing in a cooler way i think"
9963360,9969840," they're disappearing in a cooler way"
9975840,9984800," so uh all right let's maybe try um sodin pog though sodin pog it may oh it may take a lot of time to"
9984800,9991360," generate the the states because there are going to be a lot of states uh but we'll see maybe maybe that's"
9991360,9998400," going to be fine yeah let's wait a little bit let's wait until it maybe generates some states"
10000400,10010880," uh how would it look if we just calculate the frequencies only once for the first step"
10010880,10015680," we do not compute frequency for any of the steps"
10015680,10022560," when we're simulating cellular automatons we're not computing any frequencies"
10023600,10030240," at all at all well i mean technically we do but i mean that means i don't understand what exactly we"
10030240,10035040," mean right so the the whole process of this neighbor's frequency stuff"
10035040,10040960," it happens at the step of building transition table"
10040960,10049520," this function is never called anywhere during the simulation at all completely we don't even"
10050240,10055440," touch this function there it's only when we generate transition tables okay so it's it's too"
10055440,10061280," it's too difficult for this thing uh so that means i don't really understand what you mean"
10061280,10068000," like compute frequency only once per step i don't understand what you mean in that case okay so um"
10078640,10081200," so uh all right"
10081200,10088960," oh yeah all of the cell automatons end up basically collapsing but they're collapsing in different"
10088960,10095360," interesting ways i think okay so the most interesting one is probably was cycling yeah cycling is actually"
10095360,10104480," kind of cool uh right so let's actually take a look at cycling um right so let's take a look at cycling"
10105120,10113920," and uh yeah they explode essentially and they keep like having like a static noise and stuff like that"
10113920,10115840," right so"
10115840,10124320," right but if we use the frequencies right if we use the frequencies they collapse instead right"
10125600,10136320," uh they collapse instead all right and they're just like going down so it's kind of cool i really like"
10136320,10142400," that so depending on how you analyze the images and how you generate different transition tables it just"
10142400,10143520," like ends up being different"
10144800,10152480," yeah so that was an interesting project i think i think that was an interesting project"
10152480,10160000," um i didn't really achieve like the results are interesting right so like uh if you analyze these"
10160000,10166160," things different ways you get different effects which is kind of cool but to be fair i was expecting"
10166160,10170880," something more spectacular right so expecting something more spectacular but i'm really glad that i did this"
10170880,10176080," think anyway right so this one is also kind of fun they're disappearing but they're disappearing differently"
10176080,10184880," right so uh but this kind of thing actually taught me a lot uh i tried a lot of interesting things"
10184880,10191840," right um this is something that i always wanted to try so i guess this is going to be the last episode of"
10191840,10199600," this entire outer cell thing so let me uh pick maybe let's actually keep meltdown uh and let's commit"
10199600,10216080," whatever we have already uh maybe i'm gonna actually recompile this entire stuff compilation"
10216080,10231840," uh implement uh what do we have"
10231840,10244320," um try different ways of and of generating and transition"
10245120,10250640," tables uh yeah i'm gonna push that right into the rhythm"
10250640,10259120," all right so is it not poggers i think that's pretty freaking poggers um i guess that's it for"
10259120,10266480," today thanks everyone who's watching me right now i really appreciate that have a good one and i see"
10266480,10282800," you on the next azules in a session so yeah love you"
10282800,10286880," you"
